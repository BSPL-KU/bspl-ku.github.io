In this paper, the authors introduced temporal (i.e., 1 vs. 20 s) and multimodal (i.e., unimodal vs. audiovisual) features in the DNN-based encoding models that predicted whole-brain activities. They found the audiovisual and temporally more extended model improved encoding accuracies, especially within high-order sensory regions.&lt;/p>

In this study, they use visual and somatosensory tasks with simultaneous EEG-fMRI data to show the difference of the HRF&amp;rsquo;s timing and shapes by the differences of the stimulus intensity. Secondly, they show that as the spatial resolution of fMRI increases, voxel-wise HRFs begin to deviate from the canonical model, with a considerable portion of voxels exhibiting faster temporal dynamics than predicted by the canonical HRF.&lt;/p>

Associated coexpression modules were enriched in genes that are broadly expressed in the brain and many other tissues. These coexpression modules were also enriched in ASD-associated, prenatal, human-specific, and language-relevant genes. This work highlights distinctive neurobiology in ASD subtypes with different early language outcomes that is present well before such outcomes are known.&lt;/p>

A total of 51 objects each presented at 24 views belonging to 6 different categories. The fc6 output of AlexNet for object classification was PCA decomposed and used as an object space. Pooling responses across face, body, NML, and stubby networks enabled reasonable reconstruction of general objects demonstrating the importance of these four networks in object representation.&lt;/p>

In this article, they hypothesized that disease-relevant modules of genes can be discovered within the autoencoder (AE) representations. They compared shallow and deep AE with various node sizes, and showed deep AE works better. Also, they also showed that each different layer captures gradients of biology. By overlapping top 1000 genes for each disease with GWAS, they found a highly significant association for at least one layer in all tested diseases.&lt;/p>

(i.e., response selectivity) and conducted dissimilarity analysis relating these anatomical and functional properties of S1 to the physical structure of
the lower limbs. They found only minor differences between the properties of the three BAs of somasensory areas (i.e., BA 3,1,2), suggesting that S1 maps for the lower limbs differ from those described for the hand. Furthermore, this paper suggested a possible homology between the first digit of upper and lower extremity in humans, and report different patterns of selectivity in the foot representations (i.e. lower selectivity) compared to the other leg representations (i.e. greater selectivity)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A new study, that utilized machine learning tools, provides a new map that links genetic signatures to functions across the human brain!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, they found a clear genetic signal that separated cognitive processes, like attention, from more affective processes, like fear.
This separation can be traced to gene expression in specific cell types and molecular pathways, offering key insights for future research into psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cognition, for example, was linked more to the gene signatures of inhibitory or excitatory neurons.
Affective processes, however, were linked to support cells such as microglia and astrocytes, supporting a theory that inflammation of these cells is a risk factor in mental illness.
The genetic signature related to affect was centred on a brain region called the anterior cingulate cortex, which has been shown to be vulnerable in mental illness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The human brain has limited capacity in terms of the data it is able to process and save in its memory. Researchers sought to answer the following question: is the visual system capable of automatic object categorization (i.e., without attention)? To this end, they tested whether the rapid categorical parsing is automatic or requires attention. They found that spatially intermixed objects are parsed into distinct categories automatically.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Using generative networks and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers found that brain uses similar visual areas for mental imagery and vision, but it uses low-level visual areas less precisely with mental imagery than with vision.

Alpha power contrast between motor imagery and rest is widespread. (A) The Fisher score was used to plot the difference between the distributions of alpha power during motor imagery versus rest at each electrode throughout training (x-axis = session number). During the UD task, the control group (top row) displayed the expected pattern in that the difference between motor imagery and rest is determined by the presence or absence of activity over the motor cortex. However, the MBSR group produced an entirely different pattern of contrast that evolves throughout training. Brighter colors represent greater differences in alpha power between trial types. (B) Comparing the change in Fisher score across the cortex during UD control revealed the MBSR group learned to generate greater alpha power contrast between motor imagery and rest than controls across a wide range of electrodes (CBPT, P = 0.01). (C) Source imaging of the group difference in Fisher score change during the UD task again confirms the differences in learned alpha power modulation are widespread (CBPT, P &amp;lt; 0.001).
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The team found that those with training in mindfulness-based attention and training (MBAT) were more successful in controlling the BCI, both initially and over time. Interestingly, the researchers found that differences in brain activity between the two sample groups corresponded directly with their success. The meditation group showed significantly enhanced capability of modulating their alpha rhythm, the activity pattern monitored by the BCI system to mentally control the movement of a computer cursor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His findings are very important for the process of BCI training and the overall feasibility of non-invasive BCI control via EEG. This work shows that just a short period of MBAT training can significantly improve a subject’s skill with a BCI. This suggests that education in MBAT could provide a significant addition to BCI training.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Researchers have uncovered the neural mechanism underlying rumination. The study reports when rumination occurs, coupling between the core and medial temporal lobe subsystems of the default mode network becomes elevated while coupling between the core and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex decreases. According to this study, they computed the Pearson’s correlation during the activity among different brain regions. Results revealed that couplings between the core and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystems of the default mode network (DMN) were elevated while the other couplings were decreased.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Researchers conducted a first-of-its-kind study designed to investigate brain connectivity in 130 mammalian species. The intriguing results, contradicting widespread conjectures, revealed that brain connectivity levels are equal in all mammals, including humans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their study revealed a universal law: Conservation of Brain Connectivity which denotes that the efficiency of information transfer in the brain&amp;rsquo;s neural network is equal in all mammals, including humans. They also discovered a compensation mechanism which balances the connectivity in every mammalian brain. This mechanism ensures that high connectivity in a specific area of the brain, possibly manifested through some special talent (e.g. sports or music) is always countered by relatively low connectivity in another part of the brain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In future projects they will investigate how the brain compensates for the enhanced connectivity associated with specific capabilities and learning processe.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The brain is organized into a network of specialized networks of nerve cells. 
&lt;br />
For such a brain architecture to function, these specialized networks ―each located in a different brain area―  need to be able to communicate with each other. But which conditions are required for communication to take place and which control mechanisms work? 
&lt;br />
Researchers at the Bernstein Center Freiburg and colleagues in Spain and Sweden are proposing a new model that combines three seemingly different explanatory models. Their conclusions have now been published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience.

**Abstract**
&lt;br />
A new prior is proposed for representation learning, which canbe combined with other priors in order to help disentangling abstract factorsfrom each other. It is inspired by the phenomenon of conscious-ness seen as theformation of a low-dimensional combination of a few concepts constituting aconscious thought, i.e., consciousness as awareness at a particular timeinstant. This provides a powerful constraint on the representation in that suchlow-dimensional thought vectors can correspond to statements about realitywhich are either true, highly probable, or very useful for taking decisions.The fact that a few elements of the current state can be combined into such apredictive or useful statement is a strong constraint and deviates considerablyfrom the maximum likelihood approaches to modeling data and how states unfoldin the future based on an agent's actions. Instead of making predictions in thesensory (e.g. pixel) space, the consciousness prior allow the agent to makepredictions in the abstract space, with only a few dimensions of that spacebeing involved in each of these predictions. The consciousness prior also makesit natural to map conscious states to natural language utterances or to expressclassical AI knowledge in the form of facts and rules, although the consciousstates may be richer than what can be expressed easily in the form of asentence, a fact or a rule.

Recording electrical signals from inside a neuron in the living brain can reveal a great deal of information about that neuron&amp;rsquo;s function and how it coordinates with other cells in the brain. However, performing this kind of recording is extremely difficult, so only a handful of neuroscience labs around the world do it.
To make this technique more widely available, MIT engineers have now devised a way to automate the process, using a computer algorithm that analyzes microscope images and guides a robotic arm to the target cell. This technology could allow more scientists to study single neurons and learn how they interact with other cells to enable cognition, sensory perception, and other brain functions. Researchers could also use it to learn more about how neural circuits are affected by brain disorders.&lt;/p>

&lt;br />
The MRI machine reveals the fibres which carry all the brain&amp;rsquo;s thought processes.
It&amp;rsquo;s been done in Cardiff, Nottingham, Cambridge and Stockport, as well as London England and London Ontario.
Doctors hope it will help increase understanding of a range of neurological disorders and could be used instead of invasive biopsies.

&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;New technique helps elucidate the inner workings of neural networks trained on visual data&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neural networks is for performing computational tasks by learning. The learning is conducted by analyze large sets of training data. However, it is difficult to recognize which data they are processing between input and output.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A researchers from Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) of MIT, showed a method to find out the process during training the visual scenes identification. From this study, Bau, one of the researcher of this study, mentioned that it suggests that &amp;ldquo;neural networks are actually trying to approximate getting a grandmother neuron&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Scientists have long believed that the central amygdala, a structure located deep within the brain, is linked with fear and responses to unpleasant events.
However, a team of MIT neuroscientists has now discovered a circuit in this structure that responds to rewarding events. In a study of mice, activating this circuit with certain stimuli made the animals seek those stimuli further. The researchers also found a circuit that controls responses to fearful events, but most of the neurons in the central amygdala are involved in the reward circuit, they report.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For robots to do what we want, they need to understand us. Too often, this means having to meet them halfway: teaching them the intricacies of human language, for example, or giving them explicit commands for very specific tasks.
But what if we could develop robots that were a more natural extension of us and that could actually do whatever we are thinking?
A team from MIT&amp;rsquo;s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Boston University is working on this problem, creating a feedback system that lets people correct robot mistakes instantly with nothing more than their brains.
Using data from an electroencephalography (EEG) monitor that records brain activity, the system can detect if a person notices an error as a robot performs an object-sorting task. The team&amp;rsquo;s novel machine-learning algorithms enable the system to classify brain waves in the space of 10 to 30 milliseconds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>MIT chemical engineers have developed an extremely sensitive detector that can track single cells&amp;rsquo; secretion of dopamine, a brain chemical responsible for carrying messages involved in reward-motivated behavior, learning, and memory. Using arrays of up to 20,000 tiny sensors, the researchers can monitor dopamine secretion of single neurons, allowing them to explore critical questions about dopamine dynamics. Until now, that has been very difficult to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strano and his colleagues have already demonstrated that dopamine release occurs differently than scientists expected in a type of neural progenitor cell, helping to shed light on how dopamine may exert its effects in the brain.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The wisdom of crowds is not always perfect. But two scholars at MIT&amp;rsquo;s Sloan Neuroeconomics Lab, along with a colleague at Princeton University, have found a way to make it better.
Their method, explained in a newly published paper, uses a technique the researchers call the &amp;ldquo;surprisingly popular&amp;rdquo; algorithm to better extract correct answers from large groups of people. As such, it could refine wisdom-of-crowds surveys, which are used in political and economic forecasting, as well as many other collective activities, from pricing artworks to grading scientific research proposals.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In adults, certain regions of the brain&amp;rsquo;s visual cortex respond preferentially to specific types of input, such as faces or objects &amp;mdash; but how and when those preferences arise has long puzzled neuroscientists. One way to help answer that question is to study the brains of very young infants and compare them to adult brains. However, scanning the brains of awake babies in an MRI machine has proven difficult. Now, neuroscientists at MIT have overcome that obstacle, adapting their MRI scanner to make it easier to scan infants&amp;rsquo; brains as the babies watch movies featuring different types of visual input. Using these data, the team found that in some ways, the organization of infants&amp;rsquo; brains is surprisingly similar to that of adults. Specifically, brain regions that respond to faces in adults do the same in babies, as do regions that respond to scenes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our emotional state is governed partly by a tiny brain structure known as the amygdala, which is responsible for processing positive emotions such as happiness, and negative ones such as fear and anxiety.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A new study from MIT finds that these emotions are controlled by two populations of neurons that are genetically programmed to encode memories of either fearful or pleasurable events. Furthermore, these sets of cells inhibit each other, suggesting that an imbalance between these populations may be responsible for disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Scientists hoping to get a glimpse of molecules that control brain activity have devised a new probe that allows them to image these molecules without using any chemical or radioactive labels. Currently the gold standard approach to imaging molecules in the brain is to tag them with radioactive probes. However, these probes offer low resolution and they can&amp;rsquo;t easily be used to watch dynamic events, says Alan Jasanoff, an MIT professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jasanoff and his colleagues have developed new sensors consisting of proteins designed to detect a particular target, which causes them to dilate blood vessels in the immediate area. This produces a change in blood flow that can be imaged with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other imaging techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that&amp;rsquo;s partly responsible for feelings of happiness and for mood regulation in humans. This makes it a common target for antidepressants, which block serotonin from being reabsorbed by neurons after it has dispatched its signal, so more of it stays floating around the brain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIT researchers have developed an imaging technique that, for the first time, enables three-dimensional mapping of serotonin as it&amp;rsquo;s reabsorbed into neurons, across multiple regions of the living brain. This technique, the researchers say, gives an unprecedented view of serotonin dynamics, and could be a powerful tool for the research and development of antidepressants.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the developed world, with around 60,000 people diagnosed in the U.S. each year. Although there is no cure for the disease, there are treatments that can reduce the severity of a patient&amp;rsquo;s symptoms. But for these treatments to be effective, clinicians need a method to regularly monitor the patient&amp;rsquo;s symptoms in the home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a paper published today in the journal &lt;em>Scientific Reports&lt;/em>, researchers at MIT and elsewhere describe a technique they have developed to monitor Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease progression as patients interact with a computer keyboard.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>MIT neuroscientists have discovered connections deep within the brain that appear to form a communication pathway between areas that control emotion, decision-making, and movement. The researchers suspect that these connections, which they call striosome-dendron bouquets, may be involved in controlling how the brain makes decisions that are influenced by emotion or anxiety. This circuit may also be one of the targets of the neural degeneration seen in Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were able to find these connections using a technique  developed at MIT known as expansion microscopy, which enables scientists to expand brain tissue before imaging it. This produces much higher-resolution images than would otherwise be possible with conventional microscopes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The researchers from MIT team found that they could predict the child&amp;rsquo;s visual word form area (VMFA), who was in before learning reading. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion-weighted imaging in order to trace the connection between the VMFA and other brain area. The researchers recruited some children, and took the scan twice. One is when the children were 5 years old (i.e. before learning reading), and the other one is when they were 8 years old (i.e. after learning reading). Even the child who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to read (so there is no VWFA), there are pre-existing connectivity pattern for the VWFA which has different connectivity compare to other brain area. Thus, from this result, the researchers suggest that it could helpful to identify the risk of developing dyslexia or other reading difficulties.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There were unknown regions. However, by the Human Connectome Project, the researchers could identify around 100 new brain regions. To identify brain regions, the researchers used advanced scanners and artificial intelligence programs. In addition, they recorded high-resolution images, during the tests on memory, language and other tasks relate to thought. The researchers hope that these investigation, the updated brain map, will help their further work, and the further work from these identifications would be finding the connection between the brain regions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>   A study, from Elizabeth C. Mormino and her colleague, suggests that it is possible to detect the risk factors for sporadic Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s in young adulthood. One way to detect the risk is check images of a patient&amp;rsquo;s hippocampus. If the patient has a small hippocampal volume, it connotes that the patient has various genetic risk for Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s. The study was performed with 166 people with dementia, and 1,026 people without dementia (mean ages 75 years old), and used MRI images for analyzing. Also researchers checked DNA of the patients, and they calculated risk score about gene variants, which are associated with a high risk of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease. After that, the researchers checked the risk factors (risk scores and hippocampal volume) with 1,322 healthy adults the ages between 18 and 35. Finally, the researchers found, that there are association between higher risk score and a smaller hippocampal volume.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>  The researchers from UCLA&amp;rsquo;s Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center, studied brain circuits activation of teenagers, when they receive some responses (i.e. the amount of &amp;rsquo;likes&amp;rsquo;) in social networks (e.g. Instagram). The 32 teenagers (13-18 years old) were participated, and they watched 148 photographs, which including 40 of the teenagers submitted, for 12 minutes. To analyze their brain activity, they scanned teenagers&amp;rsquo; brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The result was, the brain area, which called the nucleus accumbens, was activated. Also the brain area is related to reward.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Researchers from the University of Sussex discovered the mechanism of two neurons, which relates to decision-making in the mollusc Lymnaea (corresponding to the word &amp;lsquo;snails&amp;rsquo; which is written in the news). According to the study of the mollusc Lymnaea, it uses only two neuron types for decision-making during searching food. First, the neurons report whether there is food. Second, they control the behavior. For an example, when there is no food, the neurons motivate Lymnaea to searching for it. The researchers mentioned that this discovery could be the core on developing artificial intelligence(AI) systems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>  The researchers at Stanford University performed a study regarding children and their ability of recognize their mothers&amp;rsquo; voices. The normally developing children (24 children, ages between 7 and 12) were participated to the study. The task was listening some words, and find their own mother&amp;rsquo;s voice. The kids of 97% got the right answer. The researchers used fMRI to look the kids brain. Not surprisingly, the brain activates more, when they heard their mothers&amp;rsquo; voice, than the other women&amp;rsquo;s voice. However, surprisingly the researchers found that the brain area, which is related to face recognition, was activated. 
From this, they assumed that the kids could visualize their mother&amp;rsquo;s face, when they hear their mothers&amp;rsquo; voice. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also the researchers assessed the kids&amp;rsquo; social communication scores. They found that the kids, who are most socially adapted, brain activities shows some specific pattern during hearing their mothers&amp;rsquo; voice. Thus, Abrams, one of the researchers, assumed that this result could help to examine the kids brain which regarding the social ability, for a future work.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Researchers from Dartmouth and Princeton Universities tried to show that intentional forgetting is possible. For a test, they recruited 25 participants (10 males), the age around 21.3 years old. There are many studies regarding the power of context that it helps memorizing easier. From this results, to enhance creating contextual memories, the researchers showed nature scenes (e.g. forests) to the participants during the test. The participants should memorize two sets of words, and some of them was instructed to forget some words. 
Activity of the brain was scanned by using fMRI. The result from the participant who forgot the word by context-related activity showed that they cannot remember the words a lot.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>  Lysergic acid diethylamide is illegal drug, because it occurs hallucinations. However, the researchers got special permissions to use it, for a study. They recruited fifteen healthy people with experienced in taking LSD. In the experiment, participants were injected LSD, and taken fMRI. They were asked to answers about their mood. From the result, researchers looked at the brain areas where regarding introspection and sensory areas that receives external information. They found the higher connectivity of the networks between the areas they checked. Also from the another study, the researchers found some brain area activation where were suppressed by perception during normal state.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>  A new study, regarding emotion was published in the journal PNAS. The study was to find a neural link, between understanding others and being attracted to them. The author Silke Anders mentioned that the person, who understood a partner, he might be attracted to the partner. Anders and her colleague studied 90 participants. The participants watched a video clip of women, and judged how the women felt. The researchers used fMRI to measure the participant&amp;rsquo;s brain activity. Finally, they found the participants, who understood the women more, were more attracted to her. Also,  the researchers found brain reward system activates, when the participants successfully understood the partner.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>  The neuroscientists in MIT showed that it is possible to form new memories in early stages of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s of mice. Tonegawa&amp;rsquo;s lab found cells in hippocampus which store specific memories. From the mice which has impaired memory recall but could forming new memories, researchers tried to find the reason. Therefore, they demonstrated that the engram cells is related to the fearful experience. By using light to stimulate engram cell of mice, they could find that the mice could retrieve the memory.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recently, Artificial Intelligence program, which used &amp;lsquo;Deep Learning&amp;rsquo; was shown often. Deep learning uses multiple layers called neural networks, and the concepts of deep learning is from the brain. The Google company, trying to develop deep learning. Also they prospect, it could solve many problem as education or climate change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding Artificial Intelligence, there is a AI program called AlphaGo (developed by Google), which used &amp;lsquo;Deep learning&amp;rsquo; for an algorithm. Recently AlphaGo played the board game &amp;lsquo;Go&amp;rsquo;, with Lee Se-dol who is the world&amp;rsquo;s top player of it. Surprisingly, the result was 3:1, which 3 wins from AlphaGo, 1 wins from Lee Se-dol. Also, this is not the first game with AlphaGo and human. Apple won many times, on the match against with human. Therefore, from this results, we could see the development of deep learning techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>  Since many people prefer to listen to music, some researchers were curious about the music-specific domain in our brain. However, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) showed that the speech and music circuits are in different area of auditory cortex, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) device. The researchers played a set of 165 distinctive sound clips for two seconds each, to 10 participants. From the result of computations from fMRI data, six response patterns were found. Four are related to physical properties. Other one is regarding to tracing the perception of speech, and the other one is related to tracing the data turned operatic.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>  The researchers from MIT and Harvard Medical School studied brain differences in depression with children who have have family history of it. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan children&amp;rsquo;s brains. Previous study, regarding depression shows the abnormal activity in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and the amygdala. In this study, they found strongest links between sgACC and default mode network. Also they found hyperactive connections between the amygdala in high-risk children.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>MIT neuroscientists found six neural populations regarding sounds. They are locate in human auditory cortex. Each neural population responds selectively to sounds as music or speech. The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) for the study. They scanned the brains of 10 subjects. During the scanning, subjects listen to 165 natural sounds. For the result, they could show six response patterns to explain the response variation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p> Some researchers from MIT developed a computer system which produce a character with unfamiliar writing system. Also it is indistinguishable with humans. For the computational structure, they are related to probabilistic program. This probabilistic program helps to model the concepts of human acquisition.&lt;/p>

&lt;p> Postdoctoral fellow Steven Frankland and Professor Joshua Greene of Psychology suggested that two brain regions build a new thoughts using a conceptual algebra. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for scanning the brain. The experiment is scanning the brain of participants, during reading some sentences. One of the example is &amp;ldquo;The dog chased the man&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The dog scratched the man&amp;rdquo;. The areas they found were &amp;rsquo;left superior temporal lobe&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;which is locating more toward the center of the head&amp;quot;.  Also, using the example above, they said, when they change the verb, the &amp;lsquo;dog&amp;rsquo; is recognized as the agent. It means, for building a new thoughts, we use that kinds of symbols repeatedly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dr. Fadel Zeidan and his colleagues, researched the effect of mindfulness regarding pain. They divided 75 healthy participants into four groups, control group, placebo cream group, sham mindfulness group, and real mindfulness group. First, all participants of four groups took MRI of their brain with painful heat stimulus. After that, they were trained reducing pain during four days. After four days of training, participants took the MRI again, and painful heat stimulus was given. The painful heat was identical stimulus, which the participants experienced during the first MRI scan. Except the control group, the result shows the reduction of pain from rest three groups. Also real mindfulness group was outperformed than other groups.&lt;/p>

There are several different studies in the article, and in this news, they mentioned three key results from different experiments. In short summary, the activity area of brain are depends on the task, which concerning money, and some of it could influence person&amp;rsquo;s physical symptoms. The results are, 1) When one&amp;rsquo;s money is at risk, stomach pain could occur. 2) Activated area of brain is similar as cocaine addicts. 3) The activities of brain area are shown in different parts in case of risky decision and safe decision.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>MIT neuroscientists offered evidence that the inferior temporal (IT) cortex could distinguish objects. They used the data from both humans and primates, and found activation in the neurons of IT cortex, when subject recognizing some objects. Also they compared IT area with V4 area, and found that the neurons on each area activates in some objects but not others. Therefore the researcher said we could predict the flow of recognizing image, from the retina through V1, V2, V4 also in IT.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project, which coordinated by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and which is one part of the project European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP), researched about whether people are affected by inaudible sound or not. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers could find that some area of the brain activates when infra/ultrasound is heard (above image). People can think that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear infra/ultrasound. However from the result of the research, we could find that those inaudible sound can affect people.&lt;/p>

It shows that cognitive operation isn&amp;rsquo;t occur in individual brain region. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they narrowed their focus into four functional networks. After that they looked at gene-expression profiles. Therefore from the gene activity, the researchers could find that the network-connectivity strength is shown in  genetic-variant profiles of 136 genes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, were deduced the human thinking process using simple learning tasks. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) to find some activation in the brain. For the participants, the researchers taught them eight different animals. The participants learned about the diet and habits of the animals. Using fMRI, the researcher found brain region which regarding to &amp;lsquo;habitat&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;diet&amp;rsquo; respectively. &amp;lsquo;Habit&amp;rsquo; regions shows the storing part of new information about where the animals lived, and &amp;lsquo;diet&amp;rsquo; regions shows storing part of newly learned knowledge about animals. This research could apply to objects except abstract thoughts. Therefore it could be a help to figure out the systematic learning processes of human brain.&lt;/p>

&lt;p> Matthew Lieberman, a UCLA professor, showed the human brain is preparing to focus on the other people, during resting. 
The experiment is occurred with three tasks. First task is pairs of 40 pictures, with person&amp;rsquo;s mental state captions. Second task is identical images with the first task, and it also shows the behavior captions of the person in the picture. The last third task was the images with simple mathematical equations. 
The result was, the same region of the brain activates when the subject is watching the first task figure, and when the subject is resting. However the region wasn&amp;rsquo;t activated during second and third task. 
Also the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of the participants was activated right before the task, during resting. In this case, the participants judge the figure faster, and it occurs only in the the first task. 
The last finding in this study was, the subjects who have special features of autism spectrum disorder, there are less activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and they judge slower in first task.
 Finally, from this study, researcher could find that the brain works during resting for preparing to concentrate on the other people.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In spoken language and structure of human speech, speech timing is important elements. To understand speech, brain need to interpret the phonemes, syllables and words. Therefore the brain need to take shortcuts in processing the sounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;speech quilts&amp;rdquo;, which making a new sound by cutting and reassembling 30-960-millisecond chunks of the recorded sounds, was used in the study. The researchers also used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine to check the brain activation during giving the new sounds to subjects. Before this study, superior temporal sulcus (STS) was known as the region that integrates auditory and other sensory information.
 
However, from the experiment, the researchers found the brain region, the STS, highly activated. It shows that STS is concerning with time structure in speech. For the future study, researchers plan to study whether the activation of STS in familiar speech is similar to unfamiliar speech.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>University of Michigan Medical School and Depression Center and their colleagues studied women whom had depression or bipolar disorder with healthy women. They were tested cognitive control task, which certain letters show up briefly on a screen in random series. The result was the group with depression or bipolar disorder shows poor performance on the test. By brain scanning, the researcher found the different activation level in the right posterior parietal cortex, which help controlling execution function, in each groups; healthy group, depression group, and bipolar disorder group. The depression group shows higher level than the healthy group, and the bipolar disorder group shows lower level than healthy group. From this research, Kelly Rayn, the lead author of the study, said that they showed mood disorders are shared with cognitive dysfunction, and they hope that this study will help other researchers for further study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>University of Washington researcher studied about whether dyslexia and dysgraphia disabilities are different. They used a fiber-optic pen, which records the writing of participant in real time while taking functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. For the study, there were three groups of participants, 17 children with dyslexia, 14 children with dysgraphia, and 9 children of typical language learners. The task was writing the next alphabet after the showing letter, writing missing letter, resting, and planing a text about astronauts. The result showed the different connections and patterns of white matter and gray matter, between dyslexia group and the dysgraphia group.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Babies were considered that they don&amp;rsquo;t feel pain. However in 1987, there was an experiment concerning with the pain of baby, which changed clinical practice. For pain, the experiment compared the outcome of the two groups of baby. One group received a muscle relaxants, and the other group didn&amp;rsquo;t receive a muscle relaxants. The result was the group, which got muscle relaxants, showed a better outcome. After this study, currently Slater and her colleagues studied of the babies pain by using MRI. They compared pain region of the brain of adults and babies. From MRI scans, they found that the region of pain activation of brain in adults and babies was similar.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can see the activation of anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex, when the brain experience suffering from physical or social. However, there are no localized center of pain, but it spreads to multiple regions. Some study regards the region of the pain as blanketing effect, and takes it to further research concerned with positive emotion. Based on the evidence of acetaminophen, which wipe out either negative feelings and emotional sensitivity, Way and his colleagues did two experiments. First is showing a set of images for two group; one group took a Tylenol pill, and the other group took a placebo. The participant has to rate the photos. The score was related to negative and positive emotional reaction. The result of this experiment was, the group of acetaminophen shows weaker emotional reaction than the other placebo group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The researchers thought that the result wasn&amp;rsquo;t from the overlapping the brain which governing pain, so they managed another experiment. They proceeded the experiment same as previous one, except the response how the figure seemed blue. In this test, there are no effect concerned blue. Therefore, for the final result they found, &amp;ldquo;acetaminophen reduced neural responses to social rejection in brain regions previously associated with distress caused by social pain and the affective component of physical pain&amp;rdquo; they said.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Brett Foster (a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University, told FoxNews.com) and colleagues studied about the activating area of the brain, when doing a cognitive task. The brain region they studied, were angular gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex, which comprise default mode network (which the Stanford researchers call). It is difficult to study the space by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. Therefore, the researchers used intracranial electrophysiology to study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The researchers recruited three patients. The patients have frequent epileptic seizures, and they are required to record their brain activity. Also the location of recording was default mode network. Researchers asked them some questions of personal and non-personal. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result of the brain activation order was, the vision centers, the angular gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, the decision centers of the brans, and the motor area. From this result, the authors said that the network they found, could be interesting to investigate some other research.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Brain-Wide Association Analysis(BWAS) is the method developed by researchers at the University of Warwick. It shows panoramic views of the brain, and it can help researchers to study with 3D model.  By using BWAS, we can compare all the connectivity between whole brain voxels. Using BWAS method and fMRI data, the researchers analyzed autistic and non-autistic brain. They checked the part of the voxel in the autistic brain, whether it shows stronger or weaker than the non-autistic brain. For the result, they found some key systems. One is the temporal lobe visual cortex with reduced cortical functional connectivity, and the other one is related to reduced cortical functional connectivity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By scanning people&amp;rsquo;s brain when they make decisions, scientist discovered that stress or emotion involved in in brain can cause thinking pattern change. In calm state, frontal lobes of our brains guide slow, rational thinking; &amp;ldquo;cold cognition&amp;rdquo;. On the other hand, people get stress or anger, even love, impulsive &amp;ldquo;hot cognition&amp;rdquo; decisions are made by the emotionally-driven limbic system and amygdala, which hijacks information before it&amp;rsquo;s processed the more logical frontal lobes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are two theories of consciousness: focal and global. Focal theories argue that there are specific areas of the brain for generating consciousness. However global theories contend that there are large-scale brain changes in activity. To adjudicate between those theories, the research used graph theory analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this research, researchers recruited 24 members of the university community for a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. They checked the participant&amp;rsquo;s respond of the trials and their confidence of the answer. The trials was treated as &amp;ldquo;aware&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;unaware&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the research, &amp;rsquo;no one area or network of areas of the brain stood out as particularly more connected during awareness of the target; the whole brain appeared to become functionally more connected following reports of awareness'.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We can use brain scans to many ways. It could be used for neuromarketing, checking the location of the brain function, and so on. In this article, they are focused on the neuromarketing. For an example, they talked about the beverage Coca-Cola and Pepsi. There are no explanation about how the advertising campaigns changes the perception of the drink of people. However, we can find that the brain region of memory and the hippocampus activate in case of the Coca-Cola, when the subjects know what they were drinking.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Is it possible to diagnose autism by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The professor Marcel Just and his team performed fMRI scans with two groups of subjects. One group is composed of young adults with autism and the other is general public. The test was response of different social interactions. Researchers used machine-learning techniques, and they found the difference between the two groups.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Researchers have tried to demonstrate the moral behavior has been changed as the child gets older. The moral behavior was substituted by measuring generosity. To measure the generosity, the children were participated the &amp;lsquo;dictator game&amp;rsquo;, which is sharing their own stickers with anonymous child after seeing short prosocial/antisocial animations. As the results, the automatic patterns were exhibited early while the more controlled patterns of neural response appeared later during the period of seeing animation including helping and harmful behaviors.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have only basic knowledge of how new experiences are converted into lasting memories. It is know that memories are stored primarily in the cerebral cortex. Now, Researchers has successfully determined the location, where memories are generated. They have been able to locate the generation of human memories to certain neuronal layers within the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. They were able to determine which neuronal layer was active. In terms of this study, researchers hope that might be able to assist in acquiring a better understanding of the effects Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease has on the brain.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Neuroscientist have believed that older people have less neural flexibility to learn new thing. But, according to new report, older people learned a visual task as well as young people. Researchers found that there were unexpected changes in the white matter of the brain. Researchers scanned subjects brain which is composed with young and older people. The result of analyzing is young people had changes in gray matter, while older people had changes in white matter. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recent some studies have shown that many patients in &amp;ldquo;vegetative state&amp;rdquo; may have consciousness. Researchers estimated that about 40% of the patients are partially or fully conscious but cannot just control their movement. And there is no special criteria for distinguishing people in the vegetative state from those who are partially or fully conscious. To measure the border line between unconsciousness and consciousness, EEG or fMRI have been used for that. Ultimately, the purpose is to find cheap and practical solution to detect the levels of consciousness between a vegetative state and full awareness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Scientists have know for decades that psychedelic drugs&amp;rsquo; famous effects are linked to elevated levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Researchers are interested not just in single chemicals but also in overall brain activity, because the most complicated brain functions arise from lots of different regions working together. From experiment, Researcher found two main effects of the psilocybin. New connectivity pattern tended to disperse more quickly under the influence of psilocybin than under placebo. Second effect was in the opposite direction and very different from normal brain&amp;rsquo;s stable connections.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many theories abound but most agree that consciousness has to involve the integration of activity from several brain networks, allowing us to perceive our surroundings as one single unifying experience rather than isolated sensory perceptions. Counter-intuitively, scientists found that the woman&amp;rsquo;s loss of consciousness was associated with increased synchrony of electrical activity, or brainwaves, in the frontal and parietal regions of the brain that participate in conscious awareness. The brain can&amp;rsquo;t distinguish one aspect from another, stopping a cohesive experience emerging.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To date, the cerebellum has been known as a brain region for movement control, but many recent researches have shown that the cerebellum has more functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cerebellum contains a large number of neurons but nobody knows what they are doing and they are for. This article said the difference of correlation in the cerebellum and neocortex between primate and human was found due to relatively rapid evolutionary expansion of cerebellum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In these days, some evidences are now found that the cerebellum might have a role of language and other cognitive function.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Three scientists have shared the 2014 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. This year&amp;rsquo;s laureates have discovered an &amp;lsquo;inner GPS&amp;rsquo; in the brain that makes it possible to orient ourselves in space, demonstrating a cellular basis for higher cognitive function. They found a cell in hippocampus that always activated when a rat was at a certain area. Other nerve cells were activated when the rat was at other places. Scientists concluded these cells and after that, they identified another type of nerve cells, called &amp;lsquo;grid cell&amp;rsquo;, which generate a coordinate system and allows for precise positioning and path finding.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of neuroscientists insists that brain scans can read people&amp;rsquo;s mind, soon. In order to realize his thoughts, the neuroscientist uses EEG and fMRI data. Even though two methods still have limitations, scientists can reconstruct faces that subjects are viewing during the fMRI scan. Each scientist has their own algorithms to analyze brain data, but their fundamental goals is understanding how the brain does and  what it does. A current issue of mind reading brings up important ethical and public policy questions about privacy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Though many neurons have different shapes and sizes, they have common characteristic which neuron should have in general. But newly discovered cells have different and unknown process compared to basic neurons. In these neurons, the axon does not emerge from the cell body, but arises from a lower dendrite instead. The cells were discovered in the mouse brain, especially in the hippocampus. And human have the same general brain structure and types of hippocampus cells as mice. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>A Chinese woman has been turned out that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t have large part of her brain. Nobody have known that even she is 24. She have problem on her cerebellum, which is called small brain that control voluntary movements and balance as well as learn specific motor actions and speak. But She is only mild problem speech and has moderate motor deficiency. This rare case occurs new interesting issue for many researchers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>People tend to think of our memories depend on his/her past. But the truth is, many studies show that our brains constantly edit our memories to rearrange events and change dialogue. Researchers has started researching by using engineered mice to control neural activity in the mice&amp;rsquo;s brain. Researchers give two stimulus, fear and happiness with electronic shock and interacting a female mouse. And researchers used a special blue light to control memories later. And on next experiment two group mice were experimented on opposite way. After this experiment mice had become terrified of their romantic playmates. This experiment could lead how unpleasant memories are formed in the first place and it would be helpful to clinical tools.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Researchers have found the effect of listening to the favorite song with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Listening to the song, especially favorite song, activates that the adjacent region of hippocampus, which is involved in memory and emotion. This scientific result could support that the why the emotion or mental states were experienced differently by people listening to the different genre of music. &lt;/p>

&lt;p> In detail, the children who were suffered from physically abuse and experienced any of these early life stresses have smaller amygdala and hippocampus. This findings suggest an important thing that the size or shape of brain affects  how these individuals will become in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this news, the formation/removal of the memory is addressed with the connection strength. Before being revealed this relationship, the strength of connection between neurons in brain couldn&amp;rsquo;t be explained with the process of the memory. However, the Malinow team have proved relationship between strength of connection and memory by detecting the long term potetiation(LTP) and long term depression(LTD). According to the news paper, it is said that the LTP is detected when the memory is formed and LTD is also identified when removing the memory. This news would be helpful to understand the way of forming, removing and retrieving the memory.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This article summarizes that what is stress and how the stress and brain is related. Stress can be divided into two parts. One is short-term stress and chronic stress. The short-term stress can be benefit for people but chronic stress can make the brain structure such as hippocampus or prefrontal cortex be shrink. These two brain regions function 1) the integration in learning and the memory(hippocampus) and  2) high-level thinking(prefrontal cortex). This article helps you understand stress and the effect of stress on brain briefly.&lt;/p>

One of the conceptual artist Lena Park manipulated the vibration of the water by using the brain waves in real-time. She uses five metal dishes as the speakers and these speakers are correlated with specific emotions: sadness, anger, hatred, desire, and happiness. To perform this, she used EEG headset (wireless EEG).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have already known the importance of the sleep. In addition to our background knowledge, there is some scientific evidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the paper published in journal of neuroscience, the mice which the sleep is deprived has less brain cell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though this result is from the mice, human can have similar phenomenon. Moreover, the mental disorder or mood depression will be able to be studied with sleep deprival.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many people wonder the relation between IQ and brain. There are some evidence which can explain the link between IQ and brain cortex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To jump to the conclusion, the thickness of brain cortex is associated with the IQ.
The more the thickness of cortex, the higher IQ is.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What is the definition of the beauty? The neuroscientist have found that the mathematician&amp;rsquo;s brain which is involved to feel the beauty activates to the fascinated equation such as Euler&amp;rsquo;s formula. This activated region is A1 field of the medial orbitofrontal cortex. Orbitofrontal cortex is known for playing a role of response to visual and musical beauty.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recent research
 showed that brain&amp;rsquo;s language regions (i.e., syntactic) were activated when jazz musician improvise with another musician. Interestingly, however, brain regions related with semantic were deactivate during the improvisation. Based on these results, author said that 
&amp;ldquo;Semantics has more to do with the meaning of words. So, if music has semantics, it&amp;rsquo;s not processed in the way that is traditionally used for language.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There is a book named &amp;lsquo;Men are from Mars and women are from Venus&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The neuroscientist have revealed that this theory doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any scientific evidence to prove differences between men and women. The neuroscience expert Gina Rippon, a professor at the ashton University in Birmingham, Britain, said that our brain is changed by the social role which makes us play as the one of the social society. Additionally, as the brain is muscle, it can be exercised in accordance with duty which is required to do.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In these days, To prepare the fast-paced word or our own future life, many children are needed some ability such as intelligence ability, language skills and so on. The researchers have revealed that the children who learned the music under the 7-year-old can learn other languages easier than those who did not learn the music. This means that the music training can make our language ability more powerful. Under the evolutionary evidence and scientific evidence, the reason why the neural networks involved with the language and music can be explained.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Brain games can make us do the games well by finding the number or words over and over again. That is, these games can improve our specific brain functions which can be trained. However these games cannot make other key ability( for example decision making, planning, judging) be powerful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, how can we make our brain power boost? In this news, some tips are written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tip 1. Eliminate multitasking&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tip 2. Get away from the technology &amp;ndash;just only for 30 minutes&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By inhibiting memory recall process using ECT, researchers found that participants&amp;rsquo; ability to remember details of painful memory was impaired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, they found that the effect of ECT was dependent on time, so that therapy might be effective for prolonged time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Iterative Dual-Regression with Sparse Prior (IDRwSP) is aimed to better estimate an individual&amp;rsquo;s neuronal activation using the results of an independent component analysis (ICA) method applied to a temporally concatenated group of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (i.e., Tc-GICA method). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>In detail, an ordinary DR approach estimates the spatial patterns (SPs) of neuronal activation and corresponding time courses (TCs) specific to each individual&amp;rsquo;s fMRI data with two steps involving least-squares (LS) solutions. The proposed approach employs iterative LS solutions to refine both the individual SPs and TCs with an additional a priori assumption of sparseness in the SPs (i.e., minimally overlapping SPs) based on L(1)-norm minimization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Toolbox was developed under MATLAB framework (additionally require SPM8).&lt;/p>

The fMRI images showed the anterior cingulate cortex(ACC), which is the part of the brain that recognizes a situation in which self-control is needed.  However, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) fires with less intensity after prior exertion of self control.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The MVPA Toolbox is a set of Matlab tools to facilitate multi-voxel pattern analysis of fMRI neuroimaging data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim is to create a set of open source functions in a widely-used language to facilitate exploration of multi-voxel pattern analysis techniques and to reduce the &amp;lsquo;startup costs&amp;rsquo; for knowledgeable users eager to apply pattern classification algorithms to their imaging data. By developing the toolbox in the Matlab environment, users are able to take advantage of the vast array of existing functions. The data structures used and generated by the toolbox are designed to facilitate exploration and further script development.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Useful tool on the MR tractography from diffusion-weighted imaging</title><link>https://bspl.korea.ac.kr/interesting_works/2013_08_14_useful_tool_on_the_mr_tractography_from_diffusion-weighted_imaging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2013 23:52:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bspl.korea.ac.kr/interesting_works/2013_08_14_useful_tool_on_the_mr_tractography_from_diffusion-weighted_imaging/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>MRtrix: MR tractography including crossing fibres (&lt;a href="http://www.brain.org.au/software/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.brain.org.au/software/index.html&lt;/a>)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
