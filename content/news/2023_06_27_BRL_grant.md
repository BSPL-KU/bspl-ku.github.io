We have recently awarded a new three-year grant of Basic Research Laboratory from the National Research Foundation of Korea to develop real-time fMRI-based neural reinforcement learning (rtfMRI-NRL) technique by leverating recent machine learning and deep learning models.
The developed rtfMRI-NRL technique will be proven its efficacy for the emotion regulation and social cognition.
