Our ultimate goal is to build AI-enabled models and develop their applications in real-world scenarios using brain signals. <br>

To this end, our main research themes include the investigation of brain functions measured by various neuroimaging modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), biosignals, and a variety of information and data using AI models along with signal processing and machine learning techniques. We believe our findings will be gainfully applied to develop essential applications in various domains.

# Now, the Question is 
{{</format>}}

How can we build such AI-enabled models for brain signals and apply the models in real-world scenarios? <br>

What would be the most feasible applications for us to focus on?
