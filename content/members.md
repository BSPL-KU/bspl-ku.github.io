## Faculty

### Jong-Hwan Lee (이종환), Ph.D.

My longstanding research interests have been in the investigation of hidden information underlying sensory signals and the development of efficient methods for accurate analysis of this information. My recent research has focused on the application of artificial neural networks and/or machine learning algorithms to neuroimaging data, such as structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG). In our lab, we have been working on studies/projects such as (i) a novel application of independent vector analysis and (ii) an iterative approach of dual-regression with sparse constraints on spatial patterns of neuronal activations applying to group fMRI data processing, (iii) automated classification of thought processes measured via fMRI data, (iv) analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI methods and their applications to sleep-onset/epileptic-foci detection and to denoising of cryogenic pump artifact of MRI scanner, (v) real-time fMRI based neurofeedback, (vi) nicotine addiction research via neuroimaging, and (vii) an early diagnosis of neurodegenerative and/or neuropsychiatric diseases from multimodal neuroimaging using advanced methods such as deep learning/machine learning and representational similarity analysis. More recently, I am getting more interested in NeuroAI which entails research that utilizes functional neuroimaging modalities and AI models to investigate the information processing of the human brain and/or to facilitate the development of the Human-inspired AI models using the insights from NeuroAI research.
