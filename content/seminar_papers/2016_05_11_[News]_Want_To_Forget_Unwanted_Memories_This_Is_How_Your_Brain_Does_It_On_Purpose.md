Researchers from Dartmouth and Princeton Universities tried to show that intentional forgetting is possible. For a test, they recruited 25 participants (10 males), the age around 21.3 years old. There are many studies regarding the power of context that it helps memorizing easier. From this results, to enhance creating contextual memories, the researchers showed nature scenes (e.g. forests) to the participants during the test. The participants should memorize two sets of words, and some of them was instructed to forget some words. 
Activity of the brain was scanned by using fMRI. The result from the participant who forgot the word by context-related activity showed that they cannot remember the words a lot.
