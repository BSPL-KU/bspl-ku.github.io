Summary: Summary: In this paper, the authors predicted the brain age of T1-weighted MRI images in UK Biobank dataset using 3D CNN architecture. They examined the relationship between predicted ages and UK Biobank variables which are categorized into lifestyle factors (exercise, alcohol, tobacco, ...), physiological/medical measurements (bone, cardiac, eye, ...), and medical history. They adopted attention gates as attention modules to observe activation of the CNN model, and they also visualized the model using saliency map for comparison.
