summary : They proposed BrainGNN, which is a graph neural network framework to analyze fMRI and discover neurological biomarkers. BrainGNN contains novel ROI-aware graph convolutional (Ra-GConv) layers that leverage the topological and functional information of fMRI. They applied the BrainGNN framework on two independent fMRI datasets(ASD fMRI dataset and HCP 900 subject release).
