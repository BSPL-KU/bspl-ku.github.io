Summary: The study performed traditional binary GWAS, continuous univariate GWAS using wearable combination scores, and multivariate GWAS to identify genetic variants associated with ADHD. The identified variants showed associations with heart function (MYH6, CMTM5) and ADHD-related genes (ELFN1), with some variants potentially having a protective effect against ADHD.
