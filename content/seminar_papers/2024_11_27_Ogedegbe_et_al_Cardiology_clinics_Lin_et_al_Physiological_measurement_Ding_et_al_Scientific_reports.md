### Principles and Techniques of Blood Pressure Measurement

Summary: The first study reviews the principles and techniques of blood pressure (BP) measurement, emphasizing the importance of accurate methods for clinical and research applications. It discusses various BP measurement techniques, including auscultatory, oscillometric, and ambulatory methods, and highlights potential sources of error and strategies to minimize them.

### Investigating the physiological mechanisms of the photoplethysmogram features for blood pressure estimation
Summary: The second study examines the physiological basis of PPG features for BP estimation by analyzing 65 features from 12 healthy subjects during cold stimuli and exercise recovery.
