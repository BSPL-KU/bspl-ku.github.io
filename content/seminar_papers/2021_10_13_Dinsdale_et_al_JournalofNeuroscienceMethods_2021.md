Summary: Collected knee biomechanics.using an MRI-compatible motion capture system. The study shows promise for the MRI-compatible system to capture lower-extremity biomechanical data collected concurrently during fMRI, and the present data identified potentially unique neural drivers of aberrant biomechanics.
