 Matthew Lieberman, a UCLA professor, showed the human brain is preparing to focus on the other people, during resting. 
The experiment is occurred with three tasks. First task is pairs of 40 pictures, with person's mental state captions. Second task is identical images with the first task, and it also shows the behavior captions of the person in the picture. The last third task was the images with simple mathematical equations. 
The result was, the same region of the brain activates when the subject is watching the first task figure, and when the subject is resting. However the region wasn't activated during second and third task. 
Also the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of the participants was activated right before the task, during resting. In this case, the participants judge the figure faster, and it occurs only in the the first task. 
The last finding in this study was, the subjects who have special features of autism spectrum disorder, there are less activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and they judge slower in first task.
 Finally, from this study, researcher could find that the brain works during resting for preparing to concentrate on the other people.
