Brain-Wide Association Analysis(BWAS) is the method developed by researchers at the University of Warwick. It shows panoramic views of the brain, and it can help researchers to study with 3D model. Â By using BWAS, we can compare all the connectivity between whole brain voxels. Using BWAS method and fMRI data, the researchers analyzed autistic and non-autistic brain. They checked the part of the voxel in the autistic brain, whether it shows stronger or weaker than the non-autistic brain. For the result, they found some key systems. One is the temporal lobe visual cortex with reduced cortical functional connectivity, and the other one is related to reduced cortical functional connectivity.
