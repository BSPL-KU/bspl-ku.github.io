Summary: In this paper, they made a step towards an integrative model of the brain during naturalistic perception by training an encoding model on an unprecedently-large fMRI dataset of participants watching videos. Importantly, their model is the first encoding pipeline which is simultaneously nonlinear, multisubject and multimodal
