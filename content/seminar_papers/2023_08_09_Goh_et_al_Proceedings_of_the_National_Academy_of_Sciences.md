summary : This study investigates the perception of silence by employing the auditory illusion paradigm. The hypothesis posits that if silence can be perceived, then the same auditory illusion would exist. Therefore, silence was used instead of auditory stimuli to induce auditory illusions. Participants reported experiencing the same illusions as in the normal auditory illusion paradigm
