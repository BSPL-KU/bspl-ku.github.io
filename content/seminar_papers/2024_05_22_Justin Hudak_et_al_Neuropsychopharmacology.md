Summary: This study investigates the effectiveness of the Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) program for police opioid users. Experimental results showed that participants exhibited an increase in theta and alpha brain waves during mindfulness meditation, along with improved coherence of mid-frontal theta. These neurophysiological changes were associated with reductions in opioid use, related to self-transcendence induced by mindfulness.
