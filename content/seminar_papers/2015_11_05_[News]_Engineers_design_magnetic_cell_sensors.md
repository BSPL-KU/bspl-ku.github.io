MIT engineers designed protein 'Ferritin', which has weakly magnetic characteristic. It could be used for tracking cells or monitoring interactions of cells. It is in developing step, because it is not easy to deliver this particles to specific cell. However, from this study, using the cells with 'Ferritin', researchers are able to track some activity with MRI.
