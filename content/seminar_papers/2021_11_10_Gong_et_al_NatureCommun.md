Summary: In this article, they tried to find a relationship between family conflict, parental monitoring and children's behavior problems and cognitive scores. They utilized sMRI, CBCL and KSADS to get 20 behavioral problems scores and 10 cognitive scores. They visualized correlation between these criteria and showed structural differences according to these scores. Furthermore, they performed longitudinal association analysis with baseline & 1 year later data. Utilizing CBCL scores into account in my study later seems reasonable.
