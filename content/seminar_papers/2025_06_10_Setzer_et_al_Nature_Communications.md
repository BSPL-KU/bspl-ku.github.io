Summary: This study measured sub-second activity within thalamocortical networks and nine thalamic nuclei in the human brain during spontaneous transitions in behavioral arousal state, using ultra-high field fast fMRI. The research discovered a stereotyped sequence of activity across thalamic nuclei and the cingulate cortex that preceded behavioral arousal after a period of inactivity, followed by widespread deactivation. These thalamic dynamics were linked to whether participants subsequently fell back into unresponsiveness, with unified thalamic activation reflecting the maintenance of behavior.
