### Neural correlates of device-based sleep characteristics in adolescents

Summary: This study integrated wearable device-measured sleep characteristics (sleep onset time, sleep duration, heart rate, etc.) with multimodal brain imaging data using sCCA in 3,222 adolescents participating in the ABCD Study to identify two major sleep-brain axes: one in which late sleep onset and short sleep duration were associated with reduced cortical-subcortical connectivity, and another in which high sleep heart rate and short light sleep duration were associated with reduced brain volume and connectivity.

### Physical and mental health in adolescence: novel insights from a transdiagnostic examination of Fitbit data in the ABCD study

Summary: This study analyzed cross-sectionally how resting heart rate, sedentary time, and moderate activity time measured by Fitbit wearables were associated with pleiotropic-like experiences (PLEs), internalizing, and externalizing symptoms in 5,007 adolescents aged 10–13 years from the ABCD cohort.

### Impact of Environmental Noise and Sleep Health on Pediatric Hypertension Incidence: ABCD Study

Summary: This study analyzed data from 3320 participants of the ABCD study. Hypertension was defined as average blood pressure >=95th percentile for age, sex and height. They revealed that adequate sleep significantly reduces the risk of hypertension in adolescents, independent of environmental noise exposure. These findings underscore the importance of promoting good sleep hygiene among youth to mitigate hypertension risk.
