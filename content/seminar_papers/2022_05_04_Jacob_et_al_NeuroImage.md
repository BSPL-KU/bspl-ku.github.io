Summary: They investigated periodic and aperiodic EEG parameters associated with distinct resting state networks and used simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording (resting state). They found that increases in aperiodic power is associated with an auditory-salience-cerebellar network and decreases in aperiodic power is associated with prefrontal regions. Also, they found that global neural excitability may reflect stimulus processing or arousal attributable to the uniqueness of the resting-state MR-scanner environment.
