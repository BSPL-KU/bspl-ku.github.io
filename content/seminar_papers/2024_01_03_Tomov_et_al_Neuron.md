Summary: The authors compared the theory-based RL model called Explore, Model, Plan Agent (EMPA) on Atari games with human performance and the double DQN model. The EMPA model showed compatible performances with human participants. Encoding analyses identified neural representation associated with theory-encoding and theory-updating.
