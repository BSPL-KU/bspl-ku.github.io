Could we communicate without language? It is probably yes. 

Recent research
 showed that brain's language regions (i.e., syntactic) were activated when jazz musician improvise with another musician. Interestingly, however, brain regions related with semantic were deactivate during the improvisation. Based on these results, author said that 
"Semantics has more to do with the meaning of words. So, if music has semantics, it's not processed in the way that is traditionally used for language."
