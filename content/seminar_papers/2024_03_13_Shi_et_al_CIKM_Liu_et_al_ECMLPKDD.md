### Gigamae: Generalizable graph masked autoencoder via collaborative latent space reconstruction

Summary: GiGaMAE investigated how to enhance the generalization capability of self-supervised graph generative models, by reconstructing graph information in the latent space. They proposed a nove self-supervised reconstruction loss.

### Masked graph auto-encoder constrained graph pooling."

Summary: MGAP is the novel node drop pooling method retaining sufficient effective graph information from both node attribute and network topology perspectives.
