The researchers in MIT developed a new technique called magnified analysis of proteome (MAP). It could reveal subcellular details and long-range connections. Thus, it might help to investigate the connectivity and functions of neurons in the brain. Also, the MAP imaging technique has high resolution that we could trace the connections in the brain more accurately.
