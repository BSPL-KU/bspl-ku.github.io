Summary: This study introduces BrainRGIN, a novel graph neural network (GNN) model designed to predict intelligence using resting-state fMRI data. By leveraging graph isomorphism networks and clustering-based embeddings, the model effectively captures brain sub-network structures. The authors validate their approach using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Dataset and demonstrate superior predictive performance compared to traditional machine learning models.
