Summary: In this study, to enhance our understanding of visual processes, they developed WAVE, which reconstructs visual stimuli from fMRI data. By integrating three modalities (fMRI, image, and text) to perform contrastive learning, the features are then passed to a diffusion model for final image reconstruction.
