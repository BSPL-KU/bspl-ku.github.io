MIT chemical engineers have developed an extremely sensitive detector that can track single cells' secretion of dopamine, a brain chemical responsible for carrying messages involved in reward-motivated behavior, learning, and memory.Â Using arrays of up to 20,000 tiny sensors, the researchers can monitor dopamine secretion of single neurons, allowing them to explore critical questions about dopamine dynamics. Until now, that has been very difficult to do.

Strano and his colleagues have already demonstrated that dopamine release occurs differently than scientists expected in a type of neural progenitor cell, helping to shed light on how dopamine may exert its effects in the brain.
