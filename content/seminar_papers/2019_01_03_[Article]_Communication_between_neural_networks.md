The brain is organized into a network of specialized networks of nerve cells. 
<br />
For such a brain architecture to function, these specialized networks ―each located in a different brain area―  need to be able to communicate with each other. But which conditions are required for communication to take place and which control mechanisms work? 
<br />
Researchers at the Bernstein Center Freiburg and colleagues in Spain and Sweden are proposing a new model that combines three seemingly different explanatory models. Their conclusions have now been published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience.
