Three scientists have shared the 2014 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. This year's laureates have discovered an 'inner GPS' in the brain that makes it possible to orient ourselves in space, demonstrating a cellular basis for higher cognitive function. They found a cell in hippocampus that always activated when a rat was at a certain area. Other nerve cells were activated when the rat was at other places. Scientists concluded these cells and after that, they identified another type of nerve cells, called 'grid cell', which generate a coordinate system and allows for precise positioning and path finding.
