There were unknown regions. However, by the Human Connectome Project, the researchers could identify around 100 new brain regions. To identify brain regions, the researchers used advanced scanners and artificial intelligence programs. In addition, they recorded high-resolution images, during the tests on memory, language and other tasks relate to thought. The researchers hope that these investigation, the updated brain map, will help their further work, and the further work from these identifications would be finding the connection between the brain regions.
