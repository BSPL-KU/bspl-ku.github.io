*The world's most detailed scan of the brain's internal wiring has been produced by scientists at Cardiff University.*
<br />
The MRI machine reveals the fibres which carry all the brain's thought processes.
It's been done in Cardiff, Nottingham, Cambridge and Stockport, as well as London England and London Ontario.
Doctors hope it will help increase understanding of a range of neurological disorders and could be used instead of invasive biopsies.
