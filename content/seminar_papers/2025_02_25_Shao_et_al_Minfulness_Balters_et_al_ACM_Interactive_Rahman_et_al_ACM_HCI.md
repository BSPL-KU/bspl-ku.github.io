### The Effect of Slow-Paced Breathing on Cardiovascular and Emotion Functions: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review

Summary: A meta-analysis of existing literature on the effects of slow-paced breathing on cardiovascular indices, including HR, HRV, and BP, as well as on negative emotions.The training showed a moderate effect in reducing SBP, moderate-to-large effect in increasing time-domain HRV, and a small effect in reducing HR.Also, slow-paced breathing may reduce negative emotions such as perceived stress.Long-term effect of slow-paced breathing was found reducing SBP and DBP among prehypertensive subjects.

### Calm Commute: Guided Slow Breathing for Daily Stress Management in Drivers
Summary: This study presented the first controlled study of a short, on-road breathing intervention with both calm and stressful driving conditions with a sample of experienced drivers familiar with the regular, daily, commuting experience in the US.Their stress inducing task confirmed that people were more stressed during the stressor inducing condition.Also, for those who engaged with intervention showed decrease in breathing rate during normal driving was about 15% or about one half of the intended decrease.

### BreatheBuddy: Tracking Real-time Breathing Exercises for Automated Biofeedback Using Commodity Earbuds

Summary: Here they presented BreatheBuddy, a passive respiratory sensing system that monitors comprehensive breathing biomarkers during breathing exercises in real-time using earbud’s accelerometer.Their evaluation with independent test users shows quite accurate performances. The interfaces they presented facilitates real-time breathing biofeedback to potentially make earbud as an effective tool for breathing exercises towards stress relaxation.
