summary: Here they develop and validate an accessible and affordable probe of neural activation related to reward processing in the ventral striatum(VS). Using an fMRI-informed EEG approach, they identified a particular spatial-temporal-spectral EEG representation that is predictive of the concurrently acquired fMRI activity in the ventral striatum while responding to rewarding stimuli. They found the VS-electrical fingerprint model to be correlated significantly with the BOLD signal in the VS and associated regions across individuals.
