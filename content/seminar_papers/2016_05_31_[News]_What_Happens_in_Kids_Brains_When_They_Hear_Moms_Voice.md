  The researchers at Stanford University performed a study regarding children and their ability of recognize their mothers' voices. The normally developing children (24 children, ages between 7 and 12) were participated to the study. The task was listening some words, and find their own mother's voice. The kids of 97% got the right answer. The researchers used fMRI to look the kids brain. Not surprisingly, the brain activates more, when they heard their mothers' voice, than the other women's voice. However, surprisingly the researchers found that the brain area, which is related to face recognition, was activated. 
From this, they assumed that the kids could visualize their mother's face, when they hear their mothers' voice. 

Also the researchers assessed the kids' social communication scores. They found that the kids, who are most socially adapted, brain activities shows some specific pattern during hearing their mothers' voice. Thus, Abrams, one of the researchers, assumed that this result could help to examine the kids brain which regarding the social ability, for a future work.
