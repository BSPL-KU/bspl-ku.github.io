Summary: They propose a novel framework to combine features corresponding to functional magnetic resonance imaging including dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) and SNP data from schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. For each subject, both the functional and SNP data are selected as features for a parallel ICA based imaging-genomic framework. They also assessed the correlations between the polygenic risk scores (PRS) and both dFNC and SNP components' loading parameters.
