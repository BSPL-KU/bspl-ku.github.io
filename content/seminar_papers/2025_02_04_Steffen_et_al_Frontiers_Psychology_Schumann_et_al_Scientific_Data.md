### Integrating Breathing Techniques Into Psychoptherapy to Improve HRV: Which Approach Is Best?

Summary: This study examined the effects of six breaths per minute breathing, soothing rhythm breathing, and nature video viewing on HRV, respiratory rate, and emotional regulation through a randomized controlled experiment. The results showed that both breathing techniques significantly increased HRV (SDNN, LF HRV, LF/HF ratio), with six breaths per minute breathing being the most effective, while nature video viewing had no impact; however, HF HRV did not show significant changes across conditions, and emotional responses to breathing exercises were not significantly different between clinically at-risk and non-at-risk participants.

### One-week test-retest recordings of resting cardiorespiratory data for reliability analysis
Summary: This study evaluates the test-retest reliability of heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiopulmonary coupling in healthy individuals by analyzing ECG and respiration data collected one week apart. The results indicate high reliability for mean heart rate (HR), but greater variability in RMSSD, highlighting the importance of careful HRV metric selection in research.
