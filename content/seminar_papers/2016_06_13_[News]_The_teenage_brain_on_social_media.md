  The researchers from UCLA's Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center, studied brain circuits activation of teenagers, when they receive some responses (i.e. the amount of 'likes') in social networks (e.g. Instagram). The 32 teenagers (13-18 years old) were participated, and they watched 148 photographs, which including 40 of the teenagers submitted, for 12 minutes. To analyze their brain activity, they scanned teenagers' brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The result was, the brain area, which called the nucleus accumbens, was activated. Also the brain area is related to reward.
