 Postdoctoral fellow Steven Frankland and Professor Joshua Greene of Psychology suggested that two brain regions build a new thoughts using a conceptual algebra. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for scanning the brain. The experiment is scanning the brain of participants, during reading some sentences. One of the example is "The dog chased the man" and "The dog scratched the man". The areas they found were 'left superior temporal lobe' and 'which is locating more toward the center of the head".  Also, using the example above, they said, when they change the verb, the 'dog' is recognized as the agent. It means, for building a new thoughts, we use that kinds of symbols repeatedly.
