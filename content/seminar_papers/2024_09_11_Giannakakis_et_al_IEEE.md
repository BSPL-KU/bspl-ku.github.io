Summary: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how psychological stress can be detected through various biosignals. It discusses the physiological processes triggered by stress, which are measurable through signals like EEG, ECG, EDA, and others(7 more bio-signals). The paper aims to establish reliable biosignal indices that can effectively indicate stress levels, emphasizing the need for consistency and robustness in biosignal data features.
