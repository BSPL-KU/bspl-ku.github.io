There are two theories of consciousness: focal and global. Focal theories argue that there are specific areas of the brain for generating consciousness. However global theories contend that there are large-scale brain changes in activity. To adjudicate between those theories, the research used graph theory analysis.

In this research, researchers recruited 24 members of the university community for a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. They checked the participant's respond of the trials and their confidence of the answer. The trials was treated as "aware" and "unaware".

From the research, 'no one area or network of areas of the brain stood out as particularly more connected during awareness of the target; the whole brain appeared to become functionally more connected following reports of awareness'.
