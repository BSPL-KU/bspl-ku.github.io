Summary: Researchers aimed to characterize and quantify the distinct brain morphometry effects and latent dimensions across 8 neuropsychiatric CNVs. They analyzed T1-weighted MRI data from clinically and non-clinically ascertained CNV carriers. Case-control contrasts of all examined genomic loci demonstrated effects on brain anatomy.
