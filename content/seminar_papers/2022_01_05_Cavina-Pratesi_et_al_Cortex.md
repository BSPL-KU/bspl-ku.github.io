Summary: This study shows us that the contributions of subcomponents of visuomotor activities have not been studied in detail (i.e., The contributions of subcomponents of visuomotor actions have not been explored in detail). Here, the Authors designed a Kinematic control experiment using hand. And they conducted selectivity analysis and compared it. They found/elucidated the different subcomponents of hand actions and the roles of specific brain regions in their computation.
