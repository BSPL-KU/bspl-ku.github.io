  A new study, regarding emotion was published in the journal PNAS. The study was to find a neural link, between understanding others and being attracted to them. The author Silke Anders mentioned that the person, who understood a partner, he might be attracted to the partner. Anders and her colleague studied 90 participants. The participants watched a video clip of women, and judged how the women felt. The researchers used fMRI to measure the participant's brain activity. Finally, they found the participants, who understood the women more, were more attracted to her. Also,  the researchers found brain reward system activates, when the participants successfully understood the partner.
