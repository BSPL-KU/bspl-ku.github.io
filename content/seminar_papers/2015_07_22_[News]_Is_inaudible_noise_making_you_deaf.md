The project, which coordinated by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and which is one part of the project European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP), researched about whether people are affected by inaudible sound or not.Â Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers could find that some area of the brain activates when infra/ultrasound is heard (above image). People can think that they couldn't hear infra/ultrasound. However from the result of the research, we could find that those inaudible sound can affect people.
