Summary: This study shows that long-term nasal airflow patterns are unique to each individual, stable over months to years, and can identify people with near-biometric accuracy. These “respiratory fingerprints” also reflect physiological states, such as sleep and BMI, as well as psychological traits like depression, anxiety, and autistic tendencies. The findings highlight nasal airflow as a rich, brain-driven signal linking physiology, emotion, and cognition.
