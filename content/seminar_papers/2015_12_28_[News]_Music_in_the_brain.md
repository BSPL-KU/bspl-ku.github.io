MIT neuroscientists found six neural populations regarding sounds. They are locate in human auditory cortex. Each neural population responds selectively to sounds as music or speech. The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) for the study. They scanned the brains of 10 subjects. During the scanning, subjects listen to 165 natural sounds. For the result, they could show six response patterns to explain the response variation.
