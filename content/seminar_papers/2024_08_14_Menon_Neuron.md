Summary: The author thoroughly reviewed organization of the default mode network (DMN) and cognitive roles of the DMN (i.e., self-reference, social cognition, memory, mind wandering). Finally, he suggested a new perspective of the DMN function in human cognitition, in which the DMN intergrate and "broadcast" various representations to create coherent "interal narrative".
