Summary: The article introduces Eye-LRCN, a new method for eye blink detection that also evaluates blink completeness using a Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN). This approach combines a CNN for feature extraction with a bidirectional RNN for sequence learning, and employs a Siamese architecture to handle class imbalance and limited data. Eye-LRCN demonstrates superior performance in blink detection and completeness assessment, and achieves noticeable results in eye state detection.
