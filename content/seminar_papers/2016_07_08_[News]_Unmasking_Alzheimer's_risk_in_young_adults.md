   A study, from Elizabeth C. Mormino and her colleague, suggests that it is possible to detect the risk factors for sporadic Alzheimer's in young adulthood. One way to detect the risk is check images of a patient's hippocampus. If the patient has a small hippocampal volume, it connotes that the patient has various genetic risk for Alzheimer's. The study was performed with 166 people with dementia, and 1,026 people without dementia (mean ages 75 years old), and used MRI images for analyzing. Also researchers checked DNA of the patients, and they calculated risk score about gene variants, which are associated with a high risk of Alzheimer's disease. After that, the researchers checked the risk factors (risk scores and hippocampal volume) with 1,322 healthy adults the ages between 18 and 35. Finally, the researchers found, that there are association between higher risk score and a smaller hippocampal volume.
