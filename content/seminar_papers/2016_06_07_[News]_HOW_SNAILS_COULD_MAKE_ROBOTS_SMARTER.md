Researchers from the University of Sussex discovered the mechanism of two neurons, which relates to decision-making in the mollusc Lymnaea (corresponding to the word 'snails' which is written in the news). According to the study of the mollusc Lymnaea, it uses only two neuron types for decision-making during searching food. First, the neurons report whether there is food. Second, they control the behavior. For an example, when there is no food, the neurons motivate Lymnaea to searching for it. The researchers mentioned that this discovery could be the core on developing artificial intelligence(AI) systems.
