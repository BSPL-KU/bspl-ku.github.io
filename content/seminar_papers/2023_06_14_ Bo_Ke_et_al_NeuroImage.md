summary :Here they recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI data from participants viewing affective pictures. Applying multivariate analyses including SVM and RSA. They found perceptual processing of affective pictures began  ~100ms in the visual cortex, where affect-specific representation began to form ~200ms. The neural representation of affective scenes is sustained rather than dynamic.
