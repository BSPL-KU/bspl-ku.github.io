Summary: In this seminar, we will explore a novel fMRI-to-text decoding framework named MindLLM. It combines a neuroscience-informed, subject-agnostic fMRI encoder with an off-the-shelf large language model to translate brain activity into coherent text. It introduces Brain Instruction Tuning (BIT), which enriches the modelâ€™s capacity to extract and represent diverse semantic information from fMRI signals, enabling versatile decoding across different tasks and subjects. We will discuss how to implement these techniques in our study.
