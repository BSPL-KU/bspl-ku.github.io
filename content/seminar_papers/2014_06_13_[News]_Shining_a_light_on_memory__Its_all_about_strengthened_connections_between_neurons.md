In this news, the formation/removal of the memory is addressed with the connection strength. Before being revealed this relationship, the strength of connection between neurons in brain couldn't be explained with the process of the memory. However, the Malinow team have proved relationship between strength of connection and memory by detecting the long term potetiation(LTP) and long term depression(LTD). According to the news paper, it is said that the LTP is detected when the memory is formed and LTD is also identified when removing the memory. This news would be helpful to understand the way of forming, removing and retrieving the memory.
