summary : Recently, Micro-Expressions(ME) is one of the popular research interest for Facial Expression Recognition(FER) task. In particular, depth information is often utilized to analyze micro expressions. CAS(ME) offers around 80 hours of video dataset with manually labelled micro-expressions & macro-expressions. They also provide depth information and demonstrate effective way to process depth information for multimodal MER(micro expression recognition). CAS(ME) is one of the most well-known RGB-D dataset for emotion recognition.
