Recent some studies have shown that many patients in "vegetative state" may have consciousness. Researchers estimated that about 40% of the patients are partially or fully conscious but cannot just control their movement. And there is no special criteria for distinguishing people in the vegetative state from those who are partially or fully conscious.

Ultimately, the purpose is to find cheap and practical solution to detect the levels of consciousness between a vegetative state and full awareness.
