Summary: Lower limb somatotopy mapping, In this paper investigated whether each mapped representation also responded to the stimulation of other body parts 
(i.e., response selectivity) and conducted dissimilarity analysis relating these anatomical and functional properties of S1 to the physical structure of 
the lower limbs. And also they found only minor differences between the properties of the three investigated BAs, suggesting that S1 maps for the lower limbs 
differ from those described for the hand. Further, suggested a possible homology between the first digit of upper and lower extremity in humans, and report 
different patterns of selectivity in the foot representations (i.e. lower selectivity) com+pared to the other leg representations (i.e. greater selectivity)
