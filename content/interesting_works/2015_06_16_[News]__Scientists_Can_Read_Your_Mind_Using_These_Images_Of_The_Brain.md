The researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, were deduced the human thinking process using simple learning tasks. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) to find some activation in the brain. For the participants, the researchers taught them eight different animals. The participants learned about the diet and habits of the animals. Using fMRI, the researcher found brain region which regarding to 'habitat' and 'diet' respectively. 'Habit' regions shows the storing part of new information about where the animals lived, and 'diet' regions shows storing part of newly learned knowledge about animals. This research could apply to objects except abstract thoughts. Therefore it could be a help to figure out the systematic learning processes of human brain.
