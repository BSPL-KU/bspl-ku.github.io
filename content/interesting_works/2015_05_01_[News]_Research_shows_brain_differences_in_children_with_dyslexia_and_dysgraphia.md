Figure description from the news: Todd Richards demonstrates the fiber-optic pen used in the study while inside the fMRI scanner.

University of Washington researcher studied about whether dyslexia and dysgraphia disabilities are different. They used a fiber-optic pen, which records the writing of participant in real time while taking functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. For the study, there were three groups of participants, 17 children with dyslexia, 14 children with dysgraphia, and 9 children of typical language learners. The task was writing the next alphabet after the showing letter, writing missing letter, resting, and planing a text about astronauts. The result showed the different connections and patterns of white matter and gray matter, between dyslexia group and the dysgraphia group.
