Summary: Suicidal attempt or ideation is well known associated with various environmental factors and psychopathology. In this study, they examined whether genetic susceptibility to major psychiatric disorders is associated with suicidal behaviors. Using polygenic risk scores and suicide risk measures from ABCD KSADS data, they found that MDD and ADHD are heavily associated with suicidal risks, internalizing and externalizing respectively.
