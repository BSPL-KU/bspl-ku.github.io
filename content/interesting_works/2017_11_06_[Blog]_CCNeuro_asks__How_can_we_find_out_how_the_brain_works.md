- Thoughts and discussion about the brain from Peter BandettiniÂ and Eric Wong

In this blog, the professor Eric Wong discussed about "How can we find out how the brain works?", which is asked from the Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCNeuro) conference.

In short, he mentioned that the most typical conceptual approach to understanding the brain is considering the brain is modular. Thus, the modularity is important for understanding the brain from complexity.

The more details is shown in the brain blog ([www.thebrainblog.org](http://www.thebrainblog.org/)).

Beside this issues, you could find many neuroscience related thought and discussion from Peter Bandettini and Eric Wong in this blog.
