Â  The neuroscientists in MIT showed that it is possible to form new memories in early stages of Alzheimer's of mice. Tonegawa's lab found cells in hippocampus which store specific memories. From the mice which has impaired memory recall but could forming new memories, researchers tried to find the reason. Therefore, they demonstrated that the engram cells is related to the fearful experience. By using light to stimulate engram cell of mice, they could find that the mice could retrieve the memory.
