Summary: The authors investigated the (category-selective) organization of macaque IT cortex using fMRI, microstimulation, electrophysiology. A total of 51 objects each presented at 24 views belonging to 6 different categories. The fc6 output of AlexNet for object classification was PCA decomposed and used as an object space. Pooling responses across face, body, NML, and stubby networks enabled reasonable reconstruction of general objects demonstrating the importance of these four networks in object representation.
