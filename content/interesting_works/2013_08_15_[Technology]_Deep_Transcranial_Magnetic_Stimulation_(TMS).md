 Standard TMS coils are limited to activation of only cortical brain regions, up to a depth of about 1.5 cm. Hence when treating depression with a standard TMS system, the limbic system, which is related to mood regulation and is generally deeper than 1.5 cm, is only indirectly affected.

The unique technology of Brainsway Deep TMS System enables direct non-invasive activation of deep brain structures.  Deep TMS is a breakthrough in the search for a non-invasive approach for treating common brain disorders.
