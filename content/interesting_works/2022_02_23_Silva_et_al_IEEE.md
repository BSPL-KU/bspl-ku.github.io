Summary: They tried to take advantage of the complex multidimensional subspace structures that capture underlying modes of shared and unique variability across and within datasets. They designed a new method called multi dataset independent subspace analysis (MISA) that leverages joint information from multiple heterogeneous datasets in a flexible and synergistic fashion.
