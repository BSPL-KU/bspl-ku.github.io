Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the developed world, with around 60,000 people diagnosed in the U.S. each year.Â Although there is no cure for the disease, there are treatments that can reduce the severity of a patient's symptoms. But for these treatments to be effective, clinicians need a method to regularly monitor the patient's symptoms in the home.

In a paper published today in the journal *Scientific Reports*, researchers at MIT and elsewhere describe a technique they have developed to monitor Parkinson's disease progression as patients interact with a computer keyboard.
