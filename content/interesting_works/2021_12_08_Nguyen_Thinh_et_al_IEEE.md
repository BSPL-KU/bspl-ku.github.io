Summary: This study uses their recently developed Spatio-temporal fMRI constrained EEG source imaging approach to perform source analysis on a simultaneous EEG-fMRI emotion regulation paradigm. They found cortical dynamics underlying negative emotional responses and reappraisal-based regulation using a newly developed multimodal EEG-fMRI integration technique. By using this method they could get detailed timecourses regional activities and causality analyses based on cortical current density could be identified.
