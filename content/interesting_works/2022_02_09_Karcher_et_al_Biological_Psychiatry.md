Summary: Previously, they gained factor scores using factor analysis to CBCL of ABCD data. With this hierarchical structure level, they tried to figure out the association between these factors and resting-state functional connectivity. Using the hierarchical linear model (HLM), they found a significant increment in variance with the p-factor model & 3-factor(internalizing, externalizing, and neurodevelopmental) model.
