Summary: in real-time neurofeedback experiments, there is not yet to be an empirical justification of the timing and data processing parameters. theses parameters and timing is important. so, they investigate how design parameters of decoded neurofeedback experiments affect accuracy and neurofeedback performance. and they demonstrate the usefulness of offline simulation to improve the success of real-time neurofeedback experiments.
