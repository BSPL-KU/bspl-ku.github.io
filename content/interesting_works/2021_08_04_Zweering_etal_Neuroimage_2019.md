Summary: The auditory-verbal hallucination by change of brain network function has been reported from schizophrenia patients. The goal of the paper is to investigate the modulation by neurofeedback in resting-state connectivity. They demonstrated the coupling increased between language and DMN node after the down-regulation NF. Also, they showed the possibility of NF as a therapeutic intervention
