  Since many people prefer to listen to music, some researchers were curious about the music-specific domain in our brain. However, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) showed that the speech and music circuits are in different area of auditory cortex, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) device. The researchers played a set of 165 distinctive sound clips for two seconds each, to 10 participants. From the result of computations from fMRI data, six response patterns were found. Four are related to physical properties. Other one is regarding to tracing the perception of speech, and the other one is related to tracing the data turned operatic.
