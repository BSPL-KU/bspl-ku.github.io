We have only basic knowledge of how new experiences are converted into lasting memories. It is know that memories are stored primarily in the cerebral cortex. Now, Researchers has successfully determined the location, where memories are generated. They have been able to locate the generation of human memories to certain neuronal layers within the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. They were able to determine which neuronal layer was active. In terms of this study, researchers hope that might be able to assist in acquiring a better understanding of the effects Alzheimer's disease has on the brain.
