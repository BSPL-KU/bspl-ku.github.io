Summary: The authors proposed a deep learning based training scheme, inspired by domain adaptation techniques. It is similar to my current study, but this study proposed a consecutive training process since they assumed that they may not know main task label (i.e., prediction target such as age, gender, p-factor) even they can know all available domain label (e.g., site, scanner). It would be good to present this paper because this paper has a similar, but different point of view for dealing with the scanner-effect.
