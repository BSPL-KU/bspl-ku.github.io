Recently, Artificial Intelligence program, which used 'Deep Learning' was shown often. Deep learning uses multiple layers called neural networks, and the concepts of deep learning is from the brain. The Google company, trying to develop deep learning. Also they prospect, it could solve many problem as education or climate change.

Regarding Artificial Intelligence, there is a AI program called AlphaGo (developed by Google), which used 'Deep learning' for an algorithm. Recently AlphaGo played the board game 'Go', with Lee Se-dol who is the world's top player of it. Surprisingly, the result was 3:1, which 3 wins from AlphaGo, 1 wins from Lee Se-dol. Also, this is not the first game with AlphaGo and human. Apple won many times, on the match against with human. Therefore, from this results, we could see the development of deep learning techniques.
