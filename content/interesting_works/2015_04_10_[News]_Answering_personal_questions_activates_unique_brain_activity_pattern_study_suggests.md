Brett Foster (a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University, told FoxNews.com) and colleagues studied about the activating area of the brain, when doing a cognitive task. The brain region they studied, were angular gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex, which comprise default mode network (which the Stanford researchers call). It is difficult to study the space by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. Therefore, the researchers used intracranial electrophysiology to study.

The researchers recruited three patients. The patients have frequent epileptic seizures, and they are required to record their brain activity. Also the location of recording was default mode network. Researchers asked them some questions of personal and non-personal. 

The result of the brain activation order was, the vision centers, the angular gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, the decision centers of the brans, and the motor area. From this result, the authors said that the network they found, could be interesting to investigate some other research.
