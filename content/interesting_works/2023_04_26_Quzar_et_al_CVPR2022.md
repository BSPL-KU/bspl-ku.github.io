summary : In this work, they propose the first video-based multimodal spontaneous emotion recognition that combines facial expressions with physiological data to derive the advantages of each modality. The feature vector of facial expression is fused with physiological signals including iPPG signal and HRV. The feature-level fusioned input is then processed in a 3D Xception-net based DNN model.
