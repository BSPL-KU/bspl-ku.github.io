Summary: The study into the relationship between physical function and working memory is actively underway. In this paper, they tried to find the relationships between cardiorespiratory fitness, gait speed, hand dexterity, muscular strength with N-back performance as a working memory task. The results illustrate that FPN and DMN are activated by task-evoked functional activity and the cardiorespiratory fitness and hand dexterity contribute to enhance this activation.
