Using generative networks and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers found that brain uses similar visual areas for mental imagery and vision, but it uses low-level visual areas less precisely with mental imagery than with vision. Namely, there are distinct codes for seen and mental images in the brain which can be captured by generative networks.
