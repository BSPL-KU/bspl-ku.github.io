Summary: In this paper, they used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the relationship between the p-factor(from Michelini) and executive functions. Also, they examined the longitudinal measurement invariance of the p-factor over the 3 different time points, baseline, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up. They found negative cross-sectional relationships between executive functions and p-factor at the baseline and 2-year follow-up.
