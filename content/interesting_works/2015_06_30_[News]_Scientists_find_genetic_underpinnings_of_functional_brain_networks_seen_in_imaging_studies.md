The researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine found that between remote brain regions, there is genetic underpinnings. It shows that cognitive operation isn't occur in individual brain region. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they narrowed their focus into four functional networks. After that they looked at gene-expression profiles. Therefore from the gene activity, the researchers could find that the network-connectivity strength is shown in Â genetic-variant profiles of 136 genes.
