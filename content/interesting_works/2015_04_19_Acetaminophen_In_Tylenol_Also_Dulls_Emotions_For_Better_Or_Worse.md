You can see the activation of anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex, when the brain experience suffering from physical or social. However, there are no localized center of pain, but it spreads to multiple regions. Some study regards the region of the pain as blanketing effect, and takes it to further research concerned with positive emotion. Based on the evidence of acetaminophen, which wipe out either negative feelings and emotional sensitivity, Way and his colleagues did two experiments. First is showing a set of images for two group; one group took a Tylenol pill, and the other group took a placebo. The participant has to rate the photos. The score was related to negative and positive emotional reaction. The result of this experiment was, the group of acetaminophen shows weaker emotional reaction than the other placebo group.

The researchers thought that the result wasn't from the overlapping the brain which governing pain, so they managed another experiment. They proceeded the experiment same as previous one, except the response how the figure seemed blue. In this test, there are no effect concerned blue. Therefore, for the final result they found, "acetaminophen reduced neural responses to social rejection in brain regions previously associated with distress caused by social pain and the affective component of physical pain" they said.
