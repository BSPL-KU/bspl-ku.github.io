Summary: Heterogeneity and case-control approaches to mental disorders have made it hard to link dimensions of psychopathology to abnormalities of neurodevelopment. In this study, they tried to find psychiatric biomarkers with normative modeling and machine learning using cortical volume. They showed that modeling cortical volume as deviations from normative models of neurodevelopment improved the prediction of overall psychopathology (p-factor). Also, they showed detailed group differences between MDD/ADHD and healthy groups, suggesting that the p-factor confounded case-control comparisons.
