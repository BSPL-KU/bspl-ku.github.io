Summary: Current encoding models have ignored the temporal dimension in naturalistic stimuli. In this paper, the authors introduced temporal (i.e., 1 vs. 20 s) and multimodal (i.e., unimodal vs. audiovisual) features in the DNN-based encoding models that predicted whole-brain activities. They found the audiovisual and temporally more extended model improved encoding accuracies, especially within high-order sensory regions.
