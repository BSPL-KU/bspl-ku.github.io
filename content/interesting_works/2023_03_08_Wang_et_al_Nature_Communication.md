summary : This paper introduced single-cell graph neural network (scGNN) to provide a hypothesis-free deep learning framework for scRNA-Seq analysis. This formulates and aggregates cell-cell relationships with GNN and models heterogeneous gene expressio naptterns using a left-truncated mixture Gaussian model. They integrates three iterative multi-modal autoencoders and outperforms existing tools for gene imputation and cell clustering.
