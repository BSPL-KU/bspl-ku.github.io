Summary: This paper showed the relationship between the activation of brain regions and sensory-motor semantic features. They defined five semantic features (sound, color, motion, shape, manipulation - which are related to sensory-motor experiences) for each word and observed brain regions which are associated with each of the semantic attributes. They found that four of the five attributes were related to the activation in corresponding sensory-motor regions.
