Summary:  In this paper, they investigate facial micro-expression that is getting much attention recently. They propose a novel spatio-temporal transformer architecture - the first purely transformer based approach for micro-expression recognition. It captures both local and global spatio-temporal patterns of video in an end-to-end way. This model is currently SOTA in MER(Micro-Expression Recognition) task.
