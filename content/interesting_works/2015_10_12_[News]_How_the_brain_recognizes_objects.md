MIT neuroscientists offered evidence that the inferior temporal (IT) cortex could distinguish objects. They used the data from both humans and primates, and found activation in the neurons of IT cortex, when subject recognizing some objects. Also they compared IT area with V4 area, and found that the neurons on each area activates in some objects but not others. Therefore the researcher said we could predict the flow of recognizing image, from the retina through V1, V2, V4 also in IT.
