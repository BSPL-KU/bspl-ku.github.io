Summary: This paper examines neural mechanisms for task switching in which task-relevant information involved perceptual uncertainty. As a result, the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the left hemisphere is associated with behavioral flexibility, and the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the right hemisphere is associated with the perception of ambiguous stimuli.
