Dr. Fadel Zeidan and his colleagues, researched the effect of mindfulness regarding pain. They divided 75 healthy participants into four groups, control group, placebo cream group, sham mindfulness group, and real mindfulness group. First, all participants of four groups took MRI of their brain with painful heat stimulus. After that, they were trained reducing pain during four days. After four days of training, participants took the MRI again, and painful heat stimulus was given. The painful heat was identical stimulus, which the participants experienced during the first MRI scan. Except the control group, the result shows the reduction of pain from rest three groups. Also real mindfulness group was outperformed than other groups.
