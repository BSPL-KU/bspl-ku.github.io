Affective processes, however, were linked to support cells such as microglia and astrocytes, supporting a theory that inflammation of these cells is a risk factor in mental illness.

(A) The Fisher score was used to plot the difference between the distributions of alpha power during motor imagery versus rest at each electrode throughout training (x-axis = session number). During the UD task, the control group (top row) displayed the expected pattern in that the difference between motor imagery and rest is determined by the presence or absence of activity over the motor cortex. However, the MBSR group produced an entirely different pattern of contrast that evolves throughout training. Brighter colors represent greater differences in alpha power between trial types. (B) Comparing the change in Fisher score across the cortex during UD control revealed the MBSR group learned to generate greater alpha power contrast between motor imagery and rest than controls across a wide range of electrodes (CBPT, P = 0.01). (C) Source imaging of the group difference in Fisher score change during the UD task again confirms the differences in learned alpha power modulation are widespread (CBPT, P \u0026lt; 0.001). The team found that those with training in mindfulness-based attention and training (MBAT) were more successful in controlling the BCI, both initially and over time. Interestingly, the researchers found that differences in brain activity between the two sample groups corresponded directly with their success. The meditation group showed significantly enhanced capability of modulating their alpha rhythm, the activity pattern monitored by the BCI system to mentally control the movement of a computer cursor.\nHis findings are very important for the process of BCI training and the overall feasibility of non-invasive BCI control via EEG. This work shows that just a short period of MBAT training can significantly improve a subject’s skill with a BCI. This suggests that education in MBAT could provide a significant addition to BCI training.\nhttps://neurosciencenews.com/meditation-mind-control-17071/ Mindfulness Improves Brain–Computer Interface Performance by Increasing Control Over Neural Activity in the Alpha Band James R Stieger, Stephen Engel, Haiteng Jiang, Christopher C Cline, Mary Jo Kreitzer, Bin He\n","date":1601856e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601856e3,"objectID":"5dd1a566378ec5227a041407bff26119","permalink":"https://bspl.korea.ac.kr/interesting_works/2020_10_05_cerebral_cortex/","publishdate":"2020-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/interesting_works/2020_10_05_cerebral_cortex/","section":"interesting_works","summary":"Alpha power contrast between motor imagery and rest is widespread.

Université de Montréal, MILA September 26, 2017 **Abstract** A new prior is proposed for representation learning, which canbe combined with other priors in order to help disentangling abstract factorsfrom each other. It is inspired by the phenomenon of conscious-ness seen as theformation of a low-dimensional combination of a few concepts constituting aconscious thought, i.e., consciousness as awareness at a particular timeinstant. This provides a powerful constraint on the representation in that suchlow-dimensional thought vectors can correspond to statements about realitywhich are either true, highly probable, or very useful for taking decisions.The fact that a few elements of the current state can be combined into such apredictive or useful statement is a strong constraint and deviates considerablyfrom the maximum likelihood approaches to modeling data and how states unfoldin the future based on an agent's actions. Instead of making predictions in thesensory (e.g. pixel) space, the consciousness prior allow the agent to makepredictions in the abstract space, with only a few dimensions of that spacebeing involved in each of these predictions. The consciousness prior also makesit natural to map conscious states to natural language utterances or to expressclassical AI knowledge in the form of facts and rules, although the consciousstates may be richer than what can be expressed easily in the form of asentence, a fact or a rule. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08568.pdf\n","date":1506922680,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506922680,"objectID":"677349e87d243d463ed7fbaa106dafba","permalink":"https://bspl.korea.ac.kr/interesting_works/2017_10_02_article_consciousness_in_the_machine_learning_deep_learning_perspective/","publishdate":"2017-10-02T05:38:00Z","relpermalink":"/interesting_works/2017_10_02_article_consciousness_in_the_machine_learning_deep_learning_perspective/","section":"interesting_works","summary":"**The Consciousness Prior** Yoshua Bengio Université de Montréal, MILA September 26, 2017 **Abstract** A new prior is proposed for representation learning, which canbe combined with other priors in order to help disentangling abstract factorsfrom each other.","tags":null,"title":"[Article] 'Consciousness' in the machine learning (deep learning) perspective","type":"interesting_works"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" (from MIT news) Recording electrical signals from inside a neuron in the living brain can reveal a great deal of information about that neuron\u0026rsquo;s function and how it coordinates with other cells in the brain. However, performing this kind of recording is extremely difficult, so only a handful of neuroscience labs around the world do it. To make this technique more widely available, MIT engineers have now devised a way to automate the process, using a computer algorithm that analyzes microscope images and guides a robotic arm to the target cell. This technology could allow more scientists to study single neurons and learn how they interact with other cells to enable cognition, sensory perception, and other brain functions. Researchers could also use it to learn more about how neural circuits are affected by brain disorders.\nIf you interested in, please click the following link.\nhttp://news.mit.edu/2017/robotic-system-monitors-specific-neurons-0830\n","date":1504264080,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504264080,"objectID":"00d55007c6852d2e25bad3cb829ecdf6","permalink":"https://bspl.korea.ac.kr/interesting_works/2017_09_01_news_robotic_system_monitors_specific_neurons/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T11:08:00Z","relpermalink":"/interesting_works/2017_09_01_news_robotic_system_monitors_specific_neurons/","section":"interesting_works","summary":"(from MIT news) Recording electrical signals from inside a neuron in the living brain can reveal a great deal of information about that neuron\u0026rsquo;s function and how it coordinates with other cells in the brain.","tags":null,"title":"[NEWS] Robotic system monitors specific neurons","type":"interesting_works"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Kim HC, Cho CH, Lee JH\nKorean Society for Brain and Neural Sciences (KSBNS) 2017, Aug/2017 ","date":1501979460,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501979460,"objectID":"d06b62bb59c4c463c679117aeebfcbd4","permalink":"https://bspl.korea.ac.kr/publications/domestic_conferences/2017_08_06_investigation_of_objective_assessment_of_depression_from_young_adults_based_on_brain_connectivity_features_and_biological_rhythms/","publishdate":"2017-08-06T00:31:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/domestic_conferences/2017_08_06_investigation_of_objective_assessment_of_depression_from_young_adults_based_on_brain_connectivity_features_and_biological_rhythms/","section":"publications","summary":"Kim HC, Cho CH, Lee JH\nKorean Society for Brain and Neural Sciences (KSBNS) 2017, Aug/2017 ","tags":null,"title":"Investigation of objective assessment of depression from young adults based on brain connectivity features and biological rhythms","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" (from BBC news)\nThe world\u0026rsquo;s most detailed scan of the brain\u0026rsquo;s internal wiring has been produced by scientists at Cardiff University.

One way to help answer that question is to study the brains of very young infants and compare them to adult brains. However, scanning the brains of awake babies in an MRI machine has proven difficult. Now, neuroscientists at MIT have overcome that obstacle, adapting their MRI scanner to make it easier to scan infants\u0026rsquo; brains as the babies watch movies featuring different types of visual input. Using these data, the team found that in some ways, the organization of infants\u0026rsquo; brains is surprisingly similar to that of adults. Specifically, brain regions that respond to faces in adults do the same in babies, as do regions that respond to scenes.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, please click here,\nhttp://news.mit.edu/2017/mri-scans-baby-brain-visual-cortex-0110\n","date":1484561040,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484561040,"objectID":"5f213b9eece03765bcead828eb3497b2","permalink":"https://bspl.korea.ac.kr/interesting_works/2017_01_16_news_a_glimpse_into_the_workings_of_the_baby_brain/","publishdate":"2017-01-16T10:04:00Z","relpermalink":"/interesting_works/2017_01_16_news_a_glimpse_into_the_workings_of_the_baby_brain/","section":"interesting_works","summary":"(from MIT news)\nIn adults, certain regions of the brain\u0026rsquo;s visual cortex respond preferentially to specific types of input, such as faces or objects \u0026mdash; but how and when those preferences arise has long puzzled neuroscientists.","tags":null,"title":"[News] A glimpse into the workings of the baby brain","type":"interesting_works"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" (figure from MITnew)\nOur emotional state is governed partly by a tiny brain structure known as the amygdala, which is responsible for processing positive emotions such as happiness, and negative ones such as fear and anxiety.\nA new study from MIT finds that these emotions are controlled by two populations of neurons that are genetically programmed to encode memories of either fearful or pleasurable events.

Researchers estimated that about 40% of the patients are partially or fully conscious but cannot just control their movement. And there is no special criteria for distinguishing people in the vegetative state from those who are partially or fully conscious. To measure the border line between unconsciousness and consciousness, EEG or fMRI have been used for that. Ultimately, the purpose is to find cheap and practical solution to detect the levels of consciousness between a vegetative state and full awareness.\nIf you are interested in this article, you can read more as linked below.\nRead more : http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/531.full\n","date":1415899500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1415899500,"objectID":"fa2be9223db1ebd64bc54c254a700c52","permalink":"https://bspl.korea.ac.kr/interesting_works/2014_11_13_an_easy_consciousness_test/","publishdate":"2014-11-13T17:25:00Z","relpermalink":"/interesting_works/2014_11_13_an_easy_consciousness_test/","section":"interesting_works","summary":"Recent some studies have shown that many patients in \u0026ldquo;vegetative state\u0026rdquo; may have consciousness.

My recent research has focused on the application of artificial neural networks and/or machine learning algorithms to neuroimaging data, such as structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG). In our lab, we have been working on studies/projects such as (i) a novel application of independent vector analysis and (ii) an iterative approach of dual-regression with sparse constraints on spatial patterns of neuronal activations applying to group fMRI data processing, (iii) automated classification of thought processes measured via fMRI data, (iv) analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI methods and their applications to sleep-onset/epileptic-foci detection and to denoising of cryogenic pump artifact of MRI scanner, (v) real-time fMRI based neurofeedback, (vi) nicotine addiction research via neuroimaging, and (vii) an early diagnosis of neurodegenerative and/or neuropsychiatric diseases from multimodal neuroimaging using advanced methods such as deep learning/machine learning and representational similarity analysis. More recently, I am getting more interested in NeuroAI which entails research that utilizes functional neuroimaging modalities and AI models to investigate the information processing of the human brain and/or to facilitate the development of the Human-inspired AI models using the insights from NeuroAI research.\nPhD Candidates and Integrated MS-PhD Candidates Juhyeon Lee (이주현) One of my research aims is to discover individual distinctiveness in dynamic functional connectivity. I am also investigating how information (e.g., text/language) is processed in the brain. Mostly, I utilize deep learning and machine learning techniques for the analysis.\nChangha Lee (이창하) I\u0026rsquo;m interested in developing algorithms to figure out how cognitive processes work by using fMRI data.\nJaeEon Kang (강재언) I am interested in Emotion processing with deep-learning and neuroplasticity algorithms for brain diseases with fMRI.\nMinwoo Lee (이민우) I\u0026rsquo;m interested in the research about relationship between the mind and the brain with emotion processing with multimodal data espacially EEG.\nMS Candidates Sangsoo Jin (진상수) I am interested in brain mechanisms of recognizing objects and learning complex behaviors. Current research aims are (1) designing a non-fMRI, web-based behavioral experimental framework, and (2) utilizing a VR-like environment to study reinforcement learnings in human participants.\nJinsoo Jeon (전진수) My research interest is emotion processing with deep-learning by combining multimodal datasets including EEG-fMRI.\nResearchers Soohyun Jeon (전수현) I am interested in integrating genetics and brain imaging for mental disorders.\nLab Manager Jinhong Kim (김진홍) Alumni Graduate students SooHyun Jeon (전수현), M.S., Feb/2024 Currently Researcher at Brain and Cognitive Engineering Institute, Korea University\nJunDong Hwang (황준동), M.S., Aug/2023 Currently at Neurophet\nMinseok Choi (최민석), M.S., Feb/2023 Yeji Kim (김예지), M.S., Feb/2023 Jinwoo Hong (홍진우), M.S., Aug/2022 Minji Park (박민지), May/2022 Minyoung Jung, M.S., Aug/2021 Dong-Youl Kim, M.S. \u0026amp; Ph.D., Feb/2021 Postdoctoral Fellow, Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at Virginia Tech Carilion\nNiv Lustig, M.S., Aug/2020 Currently job searching in Israel\nSungman Jo, M.S., Aug/2020 Currently Researcher at Brain Engineering Institute, Korea University\nHyun-Chul Kim, Ph.D., Feb/2019 Assistant Professor, Kyungpook National University\nDaWoon Heo, M.S.
