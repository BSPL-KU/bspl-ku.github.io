(A) The Fisher score was used to plot the difference between the distributions of alpha power during motor imagery versus rest at each electrode throughout training (x-axis = session number). During the UD task, the control group (top row) displayed the expected pattern in that the difference between motor imagery and rest is determined by the presence or absence of activity over the motor cortex. However, the MBSR group produced an entirely different pattern of contrast that evolves throughout training. Brighter colors represent greater differences in alpha power between trial types. (B) Comparing the change in Fisher score across the cortex during UD control revealed the MBSR group learned to generate greater alpha power contrast between motor imagery and rest than controls across a wide range of electrodes (CBPT, P = 0.01). (C) Source imaging of the group difference in Fisher score change during the UD task again confirms the differences in learned alpha power modulation are widespread (CBPT, P \u0026lt; 0.001).  The team found that those with training in mindfulness-based attention and training (MBAT) were more successful in controlling the BCI, both initially and over time. Interestingly, the researchers found that differences in brain activity between the two sample groups corresponded directly with their success. The meditation group showed significantly enhanced capability of modulating their alpha rhythm, the activity pattern monitored by the BCI system to mentally control the movement of a computer cursor.\nHis findings are very important for the process of BCI training and the overall feasibility of non-invasive BCI control via EEG. This work shows that just a short period of MBAT training can significantly improve a subject’s skill with a BCI. This suggests that education in MBAT could provide a significant addition to BCI training.\nhttps://neurosciencenews.com/meditation-mind-control-17071/ Mindfulness Improves Brain–Computer Interface Performance by Increasing Control Over Neural Activity in the Alpha Band James R Stieger, Stephen Engel, Haiteng Jiang, Christopher C Cline, Mary Jo Kreitzer, Bin He\n","date":1601856e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601856e3,"objectID":"5dd1a566378ec5227a041407bff26119","permalink":"https://bspl.korea.ac.kr/interesting_works/2020_10_05_cerebral_cortex/","publishdate":"2020-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/interesting_works/2020_10_05_cerebral_cortex/","section":"interesting_works","summary":"Alpha power contrast between motor imagery and rest is widespread.

goal is to investigate brain functions measured via various neuroimaging modalities including MRI (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) employing various signal processing techniques, machine

My recent research has focused on the application of the artificial neural networks and/or machine learning algorithms to the neuroimaging data, such as structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG). In our lab, we have been working on the studies/projects such as (i) a novel application of independent vector analysis and (ii) an iterative approach of dual-regression with sparse constraints on spatial patterns of neuronal activations applying to group fMRI data processing, (iii) automated classification of thought processes measured via fMRI data, (iv) analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI methods and their applications to sleep-onset/epileptic-foci detection and to denoising of cryogenic pump artifact of MRI scanner, (v) real-time fMRI based neurofeedback, (vi) nicotine addiction research via neuroimaging, and (vii) an early diagnosis of neurodegenerative and/or neuropsychiatric diseases from multimodal neuroimaging using advanced methods such as deep learning/machine learning and representational similarity analysis.\n   My previous researches were (1) to measure the features from the resting-state fMRI, (2) to examine the feasibility of modulating brain activation/connectivity via real-time fMRI neurofeedback on heavy smokers, and (3) to investigate where the brain regions are activated during the decision-making process depending on the reasoning orders. The current interest-of-researches are (1) to apply the real-time fMRI neurofeedback with a new framework to the diverse domain such as smoking addiction, social interaction, rehabilitation, and multimodality and (2) to evaluate the neuroimaging data using several methods such as GLM, ICA, RSA, MVPA, etc.\n\nPhD Candidates and Integrated MS-PhD Candidates    My interest in research is developing new analysis methods based on the interdisciplinary studies of brain signal processing and the cognitive processes, especially applying Machine learning algorithms and Deep learning techniques to the EEG and fMRI data analysis.\n   One of my research aims is to discover individual distinctiveness in dynamic functional connectivity.
